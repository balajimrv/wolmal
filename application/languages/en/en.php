  'Product Types:  </b> There are 6 Product Types available in our Community</span></p>
  
<p>
<b>- Simple Products:</b> A Simple product is a physical item that can be sold individually and has its own SKU. Simple products can be used in association with Grouped, Bundled, and Configurable Products.
</p>


<p>
<b>- Grouped Products:</b> Grouped products allow you to create a new product using one or more existing products in your store. You can choose different variations of a product to be part of a Grouped Product. Price of a Grouped Product is summation of its component products. 
<br /><strong>Note:</strong> To create this type of product, you must have at least two simple products in your store.
</p>


<p>
<b>- Configurable Products:</b> A Configurable product is a simple product with variety of options to be selected from drop-down lists. Each combination of drop-down options represents a separate simple product with a distinct SKU which enables you (the store admin) to maintain your inventory.
</p>


<p>
<b>- Virtual Product:</b> A Virtual product does not have any physical existence, and it only represents something that can be sold, such as a warranty, a service, subscription, coupon, etc. Virtual products can be associated with Grouped and Bundled products.
</p>

<p>
<b>- Bundled Products:</b> Bundled Products are also known as Product Kits. Price of a Bundled Product can be made less than the combined price of its component products. 
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> To create this type of product, you must have at least two simple products in your store.
