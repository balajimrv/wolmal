FREE TRAINING PROGRAMMES

And have Managers appointed in every selected Center  to train people on “What to DO?”, “How to Do?” etc and How they can earn (BRIDGES-The currency of wolmal.com) by doing activities every day via SOCIAL NETWORKING at Home as well as Online & OFFLINE Shopping. Wolmal provides FREE Trainings based on merits. 

BRIDGES (The Virtual Currency of wolmal.com)
wolmal.com allows people who have a valid Showcase to participate in the Bridges offer. BRIDGES are GIFTS provided by wolmal.com and  is not a right. By doing pre-defined activities on the wall as well as for Purchase of Products and services from the Certified Showrooms, Members can gain different types of Bridges every day and can be accumulated and then all the different eligible Bridges will be calculated for their values in INDIAN Rupees and converted to EARNED BRIDGES(EB). Purchases can be done online or directly at the shops and can collect BUSINESS BRIDGES (Bridges will be alloted only to Indian citizens who are living in INDIA- To participate in the BRIDGES PROGRAMME, it is mandatory to fill up the detailed personal information requested) By introducing BRIDGES, wolmal.com intends to support actively participating Members to improve their life style not only by making an income at home but also by using HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS. It will boost up the sale of SHOWROOMS and their revenue also will be increased. A portion of the profits on commissions received from them will be shared among the qualified consumers against their BRIDGES. More over a portion of revenue received from ADVERTISEMENTS will also be shared among them as Bridges. 

THERE ARE 5 TYPES OF BRIDGES
1. AB-ACTIVITY BRIDGES 
2. BB-BUSINESS BRIDGES 
3. CB-COLLECTION BRIDGES 
4. DB-DIRECT BRIDGES 
5. EB-EARNED BRIDGES

A considerable percentage of the revenue from Advertisement and Promotions will be calculated yearly/quarterly /monthly or daily and will be shared and is announced as concerned BRIDGES. All these Bridges other than ACTIVITY BRIDGES (AB) together will be calculated and finally announced as EARNED BRIDGES (EB). These EARNED BRIDGES in Indian Rupees can be redeemed for PRODUCTS or can be carry forwarded or otherwise it can be encashed if permitted (as in the case of NSO/RSO/CSO/CSO+ & FRANCHISES) & else can be returned back to WOLMAL .

AB-ACTIVITY BRIDGES 
By doing pre-defined activities on the wall, (Uploading Photos & Albums, doing Comment, Share etc) a valid showcase holder can accrue ACTIVITY BRIDGES. Every day activity inside the wall may ensure good number of ACTIVITY BRIDGES and will be carry forwarded. These Bridges are called Activity Bridges (AB). “What Activities Reward Bridges?” is displayed inside the HELP button of the LOCKER Menu. ACTIVITY BRIDGES (AB) can be utilized along with Money only to purchase products as per wolmal policy.
 Eg. ILLUSTRATION A. An active SHOWCASE OWNER can do prescribed activities and collect upto 250 ACTIVITY BRIDGES as GIFT if he/she try to do all recommended activities everyday without fail. In this way he/she can collect 7500 AB in a month. So by the end of SECOND MONTH he/she will have more than 15000 AB in his/her account.(This can be viewed inside LOCKER  and a detailed list of each micro transaction also can be viewed at TRANSACTIONS Button) The Normal value of 1 Activity Bridge is Rs.1 (One Indian Rupee). So we may say that now he/she has ACTIVITY BRIDGES to the value of Rs.15000/- in his/her account. In this month if he/she wishes to purchase Groceries &other necessary products for his Home from Certified Showrooms & when he/she purchases it as online/offline for a total bill of (say for example) Rs.30,000; as per that month policy of wolmal.com, if he/she has to pay (this is just an example only) only Rs.20,000 as CASH and the balance 10,000 will be deducted by wolmal as ACTIVITY BRIDGES from his/her account. Here the CONSUMER could utilize his 10,000 ACTIVITY BRIDGES instead of paying MONEY. So he/she could SAVE (Saving Money equals Earning Money) Rs.10,000 in that month on purchase of NECESSITY PRODUCTS of every home on every month. In other way we may say that EXPENDITURE BECOME EARNINGS. Now he/she has a balance of 5000 AB in his/her account. When he/she continues to do the activities again in the third month, he/she collects again 7500 AB and the total by the end of that month will be 5000+7500=12,500 ACTIVITY BRIDGES. So again next month also he/she can purchase products as he/she did last month & continuing SAVING MONEY every month by utilizing AB. ACTIVITY BRIDGES CAN NEVER BE CONVERTED AS MONEY.

BB-BUSINESS BRIDGES
When a Showcase Owner having valid Showcase inside wolmal.com purchases products or services from the Certified Showrooms by online/offline, WOLMAL will issue 1 Bridge (BB) for every purchase worth Rs.1000 paid as CASH and this can be accumulated. This Bridge thus accrued by the consumer by PURCHASING PRODUCTS  is termed as BUSINESS BRIDGES (BB). Wolmal will be receiving commissions from those Showrooms for that month and a portion of that amount will be used to calculate the value of each BB of every month (The Value of a single BB will be between Rs.1 and Rs.100) and will be announced on or after 25th of the next month. The value of BB will vary every month since it is calculated based on the total commissions received from SHOWROOMS. 
Eg. ILLUSTRATION B: In the first example when the SHOWCASE OWNER paid Rs.20,000 as CASH, he/she is eligible to get 20 BUSINESS BRIDGES(BB’s) in that month.(OSO’s are not eligible for any BRIDGES other than AB) If the value of One BB announced for that particular month is Rs.10, he/she may get a CASH BACK of Rs.200 in his/her BB account. (This BB can be viewed inside LOCKER at the BUSINESS BRIDGES Button) The announced value of BUSINESS BRIDGEs(BB) will be added to calculate their EARNED BRIDGES (EB) of that Month. (The Formula (which is described in detail below) to Calculate EB is EB=Value of BB+CB+DB.) 

CB – COLLECTION BRIDGES (By HANDSHAKE):
HANDSHAKE is a kind of REFERAL program by which VALID SHOWCASE OWNERS can gain COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB). By inviting Friends, Relatives and Colleagues whom you know well via a link inside HANDSHAKE MENU, Members can extend HANDSHAKE to them. When it is accepted by them and signing up via that link to create FREE account (SHOWCASE)inside wolmal.com it is considered as 1 ACTIVE HANDSHAKE (Referral) is completed. A beginner(OSO) who is of age 25 or above when eligible to attend Introductory Selection Training (NSO Training) of 3 hours duration and that NSO-(Normal Showcase Owner) can have up to 100 HANDSHAKES initially. But if he/she is selected to attend RSO (Registered Showcase Owner) Training, and when it is completed successfully, he/she is eligible to do upto 200 Handshakes.  A REGISTERED SHOWCASE OWNER(RSO) when selected to attend CSO (Certified Showcase Owner) Trainings as per wolmal policy and when it is completed successfully, he/she will be announced as CSO and become eligible to do upto 300 HANDSHAKES. Likewise a CSO PLUS(CSO+) Rank Holder is allowed to do 500 Handshakes within 500 days of Installation from the date of EXAMINATION. 
When those Showcase Owners (Technically called as PARTNERS) referred by the Member of wolmal.com via HANDSHAKES  can make BUSINESS BRIDGES (BB) by purchasing  PRODUCTS, the person who did that HANDSHAKE REFERRAL is eligible for 50% of their BUSINESS BRIDGES (BB). These Bridges he/she gained from every HANDSHAKE PARTNER is termed as COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB). (To be eligible for CB, one should have minimum 1 BB in that particular month. CB will be allotted to eligible members for a maximum of continuous 5 years or 60 full calendar months)
Eg. ILLUSTRATION C: Assume that a MEMBER has been selected to attend RSO, CSO & CSO+ training modules and completed successfully to become a CERTIFIED SHOWCASE OWNER PLUS with a “C” displayed along with his/her profile name at MY SHOWCASE PROFILE page AND IF HE/SHE COMPLETED ALL THE ALLOWED 500 ACTIVE HANDSHAKES: Assume as per previous example, he/she purchased 30,000 worth products and paid 20,000 as cash (Balance as AB) and thereby received 20 BB; all his/her referred (ACTIVE HANDSHAKE) 500 members also did the same type of purchase and saved Rs.10,000 and collected 20 BB’s. Now he/she is eligible for 50% of those BB’s as COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB). So from a single member, he/she gets 10CB (50% of 20 BB) and thus a total of 5000 COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB) accrued in that month (500 Members X 10CB = 5000CB). Since the value of BB announced is Rs.10 in that month, the value of CB will also be the same (Wolmal has decided that BB,CB & DB will hold same value in every month. So no need of separate announcement needed) By the above illustration the total amount he/she gain from CB @ Rs.10 for that month is Rs. 50,000. (5000 CB x Rs.10=Rs.50,000) 

DB-DIRECT BRIDGES
 These Bridges are exclusive Bridges alloted by Wolmal directly to FRANCHISES (CENTERS) who have done extra miles for promoting the portal.  DIRECT BRIDGES  are Calculated As 10% of COLLECTION BRIDGES(CB) of all Active Handshakes  Referred By the CENTER OWNER (OSO’s NSO’s, RSO’s, CSO’s & CSO+ are not eligible for DB). Franchise People(CENTER OWNERS) will be trained separately to improve Leadership Skills so as to develop their business by taking care of their partners successfully. They must ensure that their HANDSHAKE PARTNERS get a decent income.
Eg. ILLUSTRATION D: Assume that a Member has been selected as Franchise and all his/her ACTIVE HANDSHAKES are having 100 CB in a particular month, then he/she is eligible for 10% of CB (10% 100 is 10DB) ie. 10 DB from each ACTIVE SHOWCASE OWNER. The value of this DB will also be the same as of the announced value of BB. If he/she is getting 10 DB from 1000 Members (as in the case of a WBC franchise) , then his/her total DB will be 10,000 and if the value of BB announced is just Rs. 10; his/her income from DB will be Rs.1 Lakh (if eligible as per criteria) in that particular month.

EB-EARNED BRIDGES 
The value of Bridges BB,CB,& DB will be calculated and announced on or after 25th of EVERY NEXT MONTH of ACTUAL BUSINESS MONTH in Indian Rupees and will be announced as EARNED BRIDGES (EB) of that SHOWCASE OWNER. The formula to calculate EB is EB=Value of BB+CB+DB.  (The value of One EB will be One INDIAN RUPEE) EB can be redeemed for PRODUCTS from recommended CERTIFIED SHOWROOMS by Qualified SHOWCASE OWNERs. NSO/RSO/CSO/CSO+ & FRANCHISES(CENTERS) can request wolmal to convert EARNED BRIDGES (EB) to Money (CASH in INDIAN CURRENCY through BANK ACCOUNTS-provided BANK ACCOUNT & PAN CARD DETAILS should be furnished in advance) and after deducting Taxes(TDS) as per Government Rules, the Balance will be credited to their Bank account. 
Eg. ILLUSTRATION E: If a CSO PLUS Rank Holder has 20 BB’s, 5000 CB’s (as per all the above examples) and Zero DB’s (only FRANCHISE CENTERS are eligible for DB’s), his/her EB for this month is calculated as follows. The formula to calculate EB is EB=Value of BB+CB+DB. So here value of 20BB has been calculated as Rs.200 and of 5000 CB as 50,000. Hence EB= 200 + 50,000 + 0 = 50,200. As per Rule of Wolmal, a CSO PLUS member is allowed to Earn maximum Rs.50,000 only in a month. So here he/she can request to withdraw upto 50,000 as CASH in that month to his/her Bank Account. The surplus amount of Rs. 200 will go back to WOLMAL.
Eg. ILLUSTRATION E (1) In all the above examples the value of 1 BB is given as Rs.10. If it is announced as Rs.20, the EB has to be calculated as EB=Value of BB+CB+DB. BB=Rs.400, CB= 1,000,00, DB=0. So 400+1,000,00+0=1,00400. Here as per rule, a CSO PLUS is allowed to earn maximum 50,000 only: so the EB credited to his/her account will be 50,000 and the balance will go back to Wolmal. (In these situations Members may apply for FRANCHISE CENTERS to Gain the Full Amount).  To Earn Money, All Members have to inform the bank account details requested and also should fill up PAN Card Number. More over either Passport or Aadhar /Voter ID Number also should be filled in the space provided at Personal Information at MY ACCOUNTS menu. 


FRANCHISES OF WOLMAL
To start a FRNCHISE CENTER, eligible member has to Submit the Prescribed Filled application form in advance and if selected and allotted, has to Pay the FRANCHISE LICENCE FEE (NON REFUNDABLE) at the Bank Account of WOLMAL and an AGREEMENT in STAMP PAPER (in Duplicate) also has to be submitted by the Member.
ALL FRANCHISE CENTERS ARE ELIGIBLE TO EARN 20% COMMISSIONS ON PAID ADVERTISEMENTS WHICH THEY COLLECTED AND SUBMITTED TO wolmal.com.
There are 3 Types of FRANCHISEs- 
1. MICRO FRANCHISE
2. MINI FRANCHISE
3. MASTER FRANCHISE
MICRO FRANCHISEs: 
CAN START AT HOME.   At least A TABLE SPACE IS REQUIRED.
2 TYPES of MICRO FRANCHISES.
(1)  WOLMAL AFFILIATE CENTER (WAC) 
(2)  WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER (WBC)

WOLMAL AFFILIATE CENTER (WAC):
 Allowed to do upto 500 HANDSHAKES within the agreement period of 5 Years(60 Months) and the Maximum Income Limit in a month will be Rs. 1 lakh. The AFFILIATE CENTER is authorised to train and motivate all these 500 PARTNERS to collect their AB, BB & CB and to make sure that they earn a decent income as per their criteria. 
Here the FRANCHISE GAINS DIRECT BRIDGES WHICH WILL BE 10% OF THE CB OF Active PARTNERS.

WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER (WBC): 
Allowed to do upto 1000 HANDSHAKES within the agreement period of 5 Years(60 Months) and the Maximum Income Limit in a month will be Rs. 2 lakh. The BUSINESS CENTER is authorised to train and motivate all these 1000 PARTNERS to collect their AB, BB & CB and to make sure that they earn a decent income as per their criteria. 
Here the FRANCHISE GAINS DIRECT BRIDGES WHICH WILL BE 10% OF THE CB OF Active PARTNERS.

Eg. ILLUSTRATION F1: INCOME OF WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER (WBC)
When this Micro Franchise WBC did 1000 Handshakes and all 1000 partners purchase(example) Rs.3000 worth GROCERIES by paying an amount of Rs. 2000 and the balance 1000 paid as AB in this month, all 1000 people and the Franchise owner also gain 2 BB each. So the CB gained by FRANCHISE OWNER will be 1000 (50% of BB of all 1000 ie. 1BB x 1000 =1000 CB). The Franchise is eligible to gain DB also. DB will be 10% of the CB's of all 1000 partners. for example;If the CB of all partners are (example) 100, then FRANCHISE (WBC) is eligible to gain 10% ie 10 DB from each and the total DB will be 10,000 (10x1000=10,000). If the value announced for BB in that month is Rs. 20, the EB will be calculated by the following method. 
EB = VALUE of BB+CB+DB. 
So 2x Rs.20 + 1000 x Rs.20 + 10,000 x Rs. 20= 40 + 20,000 + 2,00,000 = Rs. 2,20,040/-
Since the WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER(WBC) is eligible only for Rs. 2 lakh in a month, the balance Rs.20,040/- will go back to Wolmal and this TWO LAKH will be deposited in his/her EARNED BRIDGES Box and he/she may request Wolmal to credit the amount to the BANK ACCOUNT after deducting TDS. This may continue and every month & the same BUSINESS may happen and can earn the amount every month for UPTO 5 years (60 Months as per agreement). (To gain EARNED BRIDGES in a month, the MEMBER should have at least 1 BB in that particular month.)

Purchases can be done online or directly at the shops and can collect BUSINESS BRIDGES (Bridges will be alloted only to Indian citizens who are living in INDIA- To participate in the BRIDGES PROGRAMME, it is mandatory to fill up the detailed personal information requested) By introducing BRIDGES, wolmal.com intends to support actively participating Members to improve their life style not only by making an income at home but also by using HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS. It will boost up the sale of SHOWROOMS and their revenue also will be increased. A portion of the profits on commissions received from them will be shared among the qualified consumers against their BRIDGES. More over a portion of revenue received from ADVERTISEMENTS will also be shared among them as Bridges. 

THERE ARE 5 TYPES OF BRIDGES
1. AB-ACTIVITY BRIDGES 
2. BB-BUSINESS BRIDGES 
3. CB-COLLECTION BRIDGES 
4. DB-DIRECT BRIDGES 
5. EB-EARNED BRIDGES

A considerable percentage of the revenue from Advertisement and Promotions will be calculated yearly/quarterly /monthly or daily and will be shared and is announced as concerned BRIDGES. All these Bridges other than ACTIVITY BRIDGES (AB) together will be calculated and finally announced as EARNED BRIDGES (EB). These EARNED BRIDGES in Indian Rupees can be redeemed for PRODUCTS or can be carry forwarded or otherwise it can be encashed if permitted (as in the case of NSO/RSO/CSO/CSO+ & FRANCHISES) & else can be returned back to WOLMAL .

AB-ACTIVITY BRIDGES 
By doing pre-defined activities on the wall, (Uploading Photos & Albums, doing Comment, Share etc) a valid showcase holder can accrue ACTIVITY BRIDGES. Every day activity inside the wall may ensure good number of ACTIVITY BRIDGES and will be carry forwarded. These Bridges are called Activity Bridges (AB). “What Activities Reward Bridges?” is displayed inside the HELP button of the LOCKER Menu. ACTIVITY BRIDGES (AB) can be utilized along with Money only to purchase products as per wolmal policy.
 Eg. ILLUSTRATION A. An active SHOWCASE OWNER can do prescribed activities and collect upto 250 ACTIVITY BRIDGES as GIFT if he/she try to do all recommended activities everyday without fail. In this way he/she can collect 7500 AB in a month. So by the end of SECOND MONTH he/she will have more than 15000 AB in his/her account.(This can be viewed inside LOCKER  and a detailed list of each micro transaction also can be viewed at TRANSACTIONS Button) The Normal value of 1 Activity Bridge is Rs.1 (One Indian Rupee). So we may say that now he/she has ACTIVITY BRIDGES to the value of Rs.15000/- in his/her account. In this month if he/she wishes to purchase Groceries &other necessary products for his Home from Certified Showrooms & when he/she purchases it as online/offline for a total bill of (say for example) Rs.30,000; as per that month policy of wolmal.com, if he/she has to pay (this is just an example only) only Rs.20,000 as CASH and the balance 10,000 will be deducted by wolmal as ACTIVITY BRIDGES from his/her account. Here the CONSUMER could utilize his 10,000 ACTIVITY BRIDGES instead of paying MONEY. So he/she could SAVE (Saving Money equals Earning Money) Rs.10,000 in that month on purchase of NECESSITY PRODUCTS of every home on every month. In other way we may say that EXPENDITURE BECOME EARNINGS. Now he/she has a balance of 5000 AB in his/her account. When he/she continues to do the activities again in the third month, he/she collects again 7500 AB and the total by the end of that month will be 5000+7500=12,500 ACTIVITY BRIDGES. So again next month also he/she can purchase products as he/she did last month & continuing SAVING MONEY every month by utilizing AB. ACTIVITY BRIDGES CAN NEVER BE CONVERTED AS MONEY.

BB-BUSINESS BRIDGES
When a Showcase Owner having valid Showcase inside wolmal.com purchases products or services from the Certified Showrooms by online/offline, WOLMAL will issue 1 Bridge (BB) for every purchase worth Rs.1000 paid as CASH and this can be accumulated. This Bridge thus accrued by the consumer by PURCHASING PRODUCTS  is termed as BUSINESS BRIDGES (BB). Wolmal will be receiving commissions from those Showrooms for that month and a portion of that amount will be used to calculate the value of each BB of every month (The Value of a single BB will be between Rs.1 and Rs.100) and will be announced on or after 25th of the next month. The value of BB will vary every month since it is calculated based on the total commissions received from SHOWROOMS. 
Eg. ILLUSTRATION B: In the first example when the SHOWCASE OWNER paid Rs.20,000 as CASH, he/she is eligible to get 20 BUSINESS BRIDGES(BB’s) in that month.(OSO’s are not eligible for any BRIDGES other than AB) If the value of One BB announced for that particular month is Rs.10, he/she may get a CASH BACK of Rs.200 in his/her BB account. (This BB can be viewed inside LOCKER at the BUSINESS BRIDGES Button) The announced value of BUSINESS BRIDGEs(BB) will be added to calculate their EARNED BRIDGES (EB) of that Month. (The Formula (which is described in detail below) to Calculate EB is EB=Value of BB+CB+DB.) 

CB – COLLECTION BRIDGES (By HANDSHAKE):
HANDSHAKE is a kind of REFERAL program by which VALID SHOWCASE OWNERS can gain COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB). By inviting Friends, Relatives and Colleagues whom you know well via a link inside HANDSHAKE MENU, Members can extend HANDSHAKE to them. When it is accepted by them and signing up via that link to create FREE account (SHOWCASE)inside wolmal.com it is considered as 1 ACTIVE HANDSHAKE (Referral) is completed. A beginner(OSO) who is of age 25 or above when eligible to attend Introductory Selection Training (NSO Training) of 3 hours duration and that NSO-(Normal Showcase Owner) can have up to 100 HANDSHAKES initially. But if he/she is selected to attend RSO (Registered Showcase Owner) Training, and when it is completed successfully, he/she is eligible to do upto 200 Handshakes.  A REGISTERED SHOWCASE OWNER(RSO) when selected to attend CSO (Certified Showcase Owner) Trainings as per wolmal policy and when it is completed successfully, he/she will be announced as CSO and become eligible to do upto 300 HANDSHAKES. Likewise a CSO PLUS(CSO+) Rank Holder is allowed to do 500 Handshakes within 500 days of Installation from the date of EXAMINATION. 
When those Showcase Owners (Technically called as PARTNERS) referred by the Member of wolmal.com via HANDSHAKES  can make BUSINESS BRIDGES (BB) by purchasing  PRODUCTS, the person who did that HANDSHAKE REFERRAL is eligible for 50% of their BUSINESS BRIDGES (BB). These Bridges he/she gained from every HANDSHAKE PARTNER is termed as COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB). (To be eligible for CB, one should have minimum 1 BB in that particular month. CB will be allotted to eligible members for a maximum of continuous 5 years or 60 full calendar months)
Eg. ILLUSTRATION C: Assume that a MEMBER has been selected to attend RSO, CSO & CSO+ training modules and completed successfully to become a CERTIFIED SHOWCASE OWNER PLUS with a “C” displayed along with his/her profile name at MY SHOWCASE PROFILE page AND IF HE/SHE COMPLETED ALL THE ALLOWED 500 ACTIVE HANDSHAKES: Assume as per previous example, he/she purchased 30,000 worth products and paid 20,000 as cash (Balance as AB) and thereby received 20 BB; all his/her referred (ACTIVE HANDSHAKE) 500 members also did the same type of purchase and saved Rs.10,000 and collected 20 BB’s. Now he/she is eligible for 50% of those BB’s as COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB). So from a single member, he/she gets 10CB (50% of 20 BB) and thus a total of 5000 COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB) accrued in that month (500 Members X 10CB = 5000CB). Since the value of BB announced is Rs.10 in that month, the value of CB will also be the same (Wolmal has decided that BB,CB & DB will hold same value in every month. So no need of separate announcement needed) By the above illustration the total amount he/she gain from CB @ Rs.10 for that month is Rs. 50,000. (5000 CB x Rs.10=Rs.50,000) 

DB-DIRECT BRIDGES
 These Bridges are exclusive Bridges alloted by Wolmal directly to FRANCHISES (CENTERS) who have done extra miles for promoting the portal.  DIRECT BRIDGES  are Calculated As 10% of COLLECTION BRIDGES(CB) of all Active Handshakes  Referred By the CENTER OWNER (OSO’s NSO’s, RSO’s, CSO’s & CSO+ are not eligible for DB). Franchise People(CENTER OWNERS) will be trained separately to improve Leadership Skills so as to develop their business by taking care of their partners successfully. They must ensure that their HANDSHAKE PARTNERS get a decent income.
Eg. ILLUSTRATION D: Assume that a Member has been selected as Franchise and all his/her ACTIVE HANDSHAKES are having 100 CB in a particular month, then he/she is eligible for 10% of CB (10% 100 is 10DB) ie. 10 DB from each ACTIVE SHOWCASE OWNER. The value of this DB will also be the same as of the announced value of BB. If he/she is getting 10 DB from 1000 Members (as in the case of a WBC franchise) , then his/her total DB will be 10,000 and if the value of BB announced is just Rs. 10; his/her income from DB will be Rs.1 Lakh (if eligible as per criteria) in that particular month.

EB-EARNED BRIDGES 
The value of Bridges BB,CB,& DB will be calculated and announced on or after 25th of EVERY NEXT MONTH of ACTUAL BUSINESS MONTH in Indian Rupees and will be announced as EARNED BRIDGES (EB) of that SHOWCASE OWNER. The formula to calculate EB is EB=Value of BB+CB+DB.  (The value of One EB will be One INDIAN RUPEE) EB can be redeemed for PRODUCTS from recommended CERTIFIED SHOWROOMS by Qualified SHOWCASE OWNERs. NSO/RSO/CSO/CSO+ & FRANCHISES(CENTERS) can request wolmal to convert EARNED BRIDGES (EB) to Money (CASH in INDIAN CURRENCY through BANK ACCOUNTS-provided BANK ACCOUNT & PAN CARD DETAILS should be furnished in advance) and after deducting Taxes(TDS) as per Government Rules, the Balance will be credited to their Bank account. 
Eg. ILLUSTRATION E: If a CSO PLUS Rank Holder has 20 BB’s, 5000 CB’s (as per all the above examples) and Zero DB’s (only FRANCHISE CENTERS are eligible for DB’s), his/her EB for this month is calculated as follows. The formula to calculate EB is EB=Value of BB+CB+DB. So here value of 20BB has been calculated as Rs.200 and of 5000 CB as 50,000. Hence EB= 200 + 50,000 + 0 = 50,200. As per Rule of Wolmal, a CSO PLUS member is allowed to Earn maximum Rs.50,000 only in a month. So here he/she can request to withdraw upto 50,000 as CASH in that month to his/her Bank Account. The surplus amount of Rs. 200 will go back to WOLMAL.
Eg. ILLUSTRATION E (1) In all the above examples the value of 1 BB is given as Rs.10. If it is announced as Rs.20, the EB has to be calculated as EB=Value of BB+CB+DB. BB=Rs.400, CB= 1,000,00, DB=0. So 400+1,000,00+0=1,00400. Here as per rule, a CSO PLUS is allowed to earn maximum 50,000 only: so the EB credited to his/her account will be 50,000 and the balance will go back to Wolmal. (In these situations Members may apply for FRANCHISE CENTERS to Gain the Full Amount).  To Earn Money, All Members have to inform the bank account details requested and also should fill up PAN Card Number. More over either Passport or Aadhar /Voter ID Number also should be filled in the space provided at Personal Information at MY ACCOUNTS menu. 


FRANCHISES OF WOLMAL
To start a FRNCHISE CENTER, eligible member has to Submit the Prescribed Filled application form in advance and if selected and allotted, has to Pay the FRANCHISE LICENCE FEE (NON REFUNDABLE) at the Bank Account of WOLMAL and an AGREEMENT in STAMP PAPER (in Duplicate) also has to be submitted by the Member.
ALL FRANCHISE CENTERS ARE ELIGIBLE TO EARN 20% COMMISSIONS ON PAID ADVERTISEMENTS WHICH THEY COLLECTED AND SUBMITTED TO wolmal.com.
There are 3 Types of FRANCHISEs- 
1. MICRO FRANCHISE
2. MINI FRANCHISE
3. MASTER FRANCHISE
MICRO FRANCHISEs: 
CAN START AT HOME.   At least A TABLE SPACE IS REQUIRED.
2 TYPES of MICRO FRANCHISES.
(1)  WOLMAL AFFILIATE CENTER (WAC) 
(2)  WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER (WBC)

WOLMAL AFFILIATE CENTER (WAC):
 Allowed to do upto 500 HANDSHAKES within the agreement period of 5 Years(60 Months) and the Maximum Income Limit in a month will be Rs. 1 lakh. The AFFILIATE CENTER is authorised to train and motivate all these 500 PARTNERS to collect their AB, BB & CB and to make sure that they earn a decent income as per their criteria. 
Here the FRANCHISE GAINS DIRECT BRIDGES WHICH WILL BE 10% OF THE CB OF Active PARTNERS.

WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER (WBC): 
Allowed to do upto 1000 HANDSHAKES within the agreement period of 5 Years(60 Months) and the Maximum Income Limit in a month will be Rs. 2 lakh. The BUSINESS CENTER is authorised to train and motivate all these 1000 PARTNERS to collect their AB, BB & CB and to make sure that they earn a decent income as per their criteria. 
Here the FRANCHISE GAINS DIRECT BRIDGES WHICH WILL BE 10% OF THE CB OF Active PARTNERS.

Eg. ILLUSTRATION F1: INCOME OF WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER (WBC)
When this Micro Franchise WBC did 1000 Handshakes and all 1000 partners purchase(example) Rs.3000 worth GROCERIES by paying an amount of Rs. 2000 and the balance 1000 paid as AB in this month, all 1000 people and the Franchise owner also gain 2 BB each. So the CB gained by FRANCHISE OWNER will be 1000 (50% of BB of all 1000 ie. 1BB x 1000 =1000 CB). The Franchise is eligible to gain DB also. DB will be 10% of the CB's of all 1000 partners. for example;If the CB of all partners are (example) 100, then FRANCHISE (WBC) is eligible to gain 10% ie 10 DB from each and the total DB will be 10,000 (10x1000=10,000). If the value announced for BB in that month is Rs. 20, the EB will be calculated by the following method. 
EB = VALUE of BB+CB+DB. 
So 2x Rs.20 + 1000 x Rs.20 + 10,000 x Rs. 20= 40 + 20,000 + 2,00,000 = Rs. 2,20,040/-
Since the WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER(WBC) is eligible only for Rs. 2 lakh in a month, the balance Rs.20,040/- will go back to Wolmal and this TWO LAKH will be deposited in his/her EARNED BRIDGES Box and he/she may request Wolmal to credit the amount to the BANK ACCOUNT after deducting TDS. This may continue and every month & the same BUSINESS may happen and can earn the amount every month for UPTO 5 years (60 Months as per agreement). (To gain EARNED BRIDGES in a month, the MEMBER should have at least 1 BB in that particular month.)

DISCLAIMER: Earnings & Income will be directly proportionate to the Efforts & Hard work by Members.
Wolmal doesn't guarantee any amount for any activity or work done by members. The Illustrations above are only an indication for demonstration purpose.

FREE TRAINING PROGRAMMES
WOLMAL has Training Centers to provide Quality Trainings in Chennai,INDIA.  And have Managers appointed in every selected Center  to train people on “What to DO?”, “How to Do?” etc and How they can earn (BRIDGES-The currency of wolmal.com) by doing activities every day via SOCIAL NETWORKING at Home as well as Online & OFFLINE Shopping. Wolmal provides FREE Trainings based on merits. 

BRIDGES (The Virtual Currency of wolmal.com)
wolmal.com allows people who have a valid Showcase to participate in the Bridges offer. BRIDGES are GIFTS provided by wolmal.com and  is not a right. By doing pre-defined activities on the wall as well as for Purchase of Products and services from the Certified Showrooms, Members can gain different types of Bridges every day and can be accumulated and then all the different eligible Bridges will be calculated for their values in INDIAN Rupees and converted to EARNED BRIDGES(EB). Purchases can be done online or directly at the shops and can collect BUSINESS BRIDGES (Bridges will be alloted only to Indian citizens who are living in INDIA- To participate in the BRIDGES PROGRAMME, it is mandatory to fill up the detailed personal information requested) By introducing BRIDGES, wolmal.com intends to support actively participating Members to improve their life style not only by making an income at home but also by using HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS. It will boost up the sale of SHOWROOMS and their revenue also will be increased. A portion of the profits on commissions received from them will be shared among the qualified consumers against their BRIDGES. More over a portion of revenue received from ADVERTISEMENTS will also be shared among them as Bridges. 

THERE ARE 5 TYPES OF BRIDGES
1. AB-ACTIVITY BRIDGES 
2. BB-BUSINESS BRIDGES 
3. CB-COLLECTION BRIDGES 
4. DB-DIRECT BRIDGES 
5. EB-EARNED BRIDGES

A considerable percentage of the revenue from Advertisement and Promotions will be calculated yearly/quarterly /monthly or daily and will be shared and is announced as concerned BRIDGES. All these Bridges other than ACTIVITY BRIDGES (AB) together will be calculated and finally announced as EARNED BRIDGES (EB). These EARNED BRIDGES in Indian Rupees can be redeemed for PRODUCTS or can be carry forwarded or otherwise it can be encashed if permitted (as in the case of NSO/RSO/CSO/CSO+ & FRANCHISES) & else can be returned back to WOLMAL .

AB-ACTIVITY BRIDGES 
By doing pre-defined activities on the wall, (Uploading Photos & Albums, doing Comment, Share etc) a valid showcase holder can accrue ACTIVITY BRIDGES. Every day activity inside the wall may ensure good number of ACTIVITY BRIDGES and will be carry forwarded. These Bridges are called Activity Bridges (AB). “What Activities Reward Bridges?” is displayed inside the HELP button of the LOCKER Menu. ACTIVITY BRIDGES (AB) can be utilized along with Money only to purchase products as per wolmal policy.
 Eg. ILLUSTRATION A. An active SHOWCASE OWNER can do prescribed activities and collect upto 250 ACTIVITY BRIDGES as GIFT if he/she try to do all recommended activities everyday without fail. In this way he/she can collect 7500 AB in a month. So by the end of SECOND MONTH he/she will have more than 15000 AB in his/her account.(This can be viewed inside LOCKER  and a detailed list of each micro transaction also can be viewed at TRANSACTIONS Button) The Normal value of 1 Activity Bridge is Rs.1 (One Indian Rupee). So we may say that now he/she has ACTIVITY BRIDGES to the value of Rs.15000/- in his/her account. In this month if he/she wishes to purchase Groceries &other necessary products for his Home from Certified Showrooms & when he/she purchases it as online/offline for a total bill of (say for example) Rs.30,000; as per that month policy of wolmal.com, if he/she has to pay (this is just an example only) only Rs.20,000 as CASH and the balance 10,000 will be deducted by wolmal as ACTIVITY BRIDGES from his/her account. Here the CONSUMER could utilize his 10,000 ACTIVITY BRIDGES instead of paying MONEY. So he/she could SAVE (Saving Money equals Earning Money) Rs.10,000 in that month on purchase of NECESSITY PRODUCTS of every home on every month. In other way we may say that EXPENDITURE BECOME EARNINGS. Now he/she has a balance of 5000 AB in his/her account. When he/she continues to do the activities again in the third month, he/she collects again 7500 AB and the total by the end of that month will be 5000+7500=12,500 ACTIVITY BRIDGES. So again next month also he/she can purchase products as he/she did last month & continuing SAVING MONEY every month by utilizing AB. ACTIVITY BRIDGES CAN NEVER BE CONVERTED AS MONEY.

BB-BUSINESS BRIDGES
When a Showcase Owner having valid Showcase inside wolmal.com purchases products or services from the Certified Showrooms by online/offline, WOLMAL will issue 1 Bridge (BB) for every purchase worth Rs.1000 paid as CASH and this can be accumulated. This Bridge thus accrued by the consumer by PURCHASING PRODUCTS  is termed as BUSINESS BRIDGES (BB). Wolmal will be receiving commissions from those Showrooms for that month and a portion of that amount will be used to calculate the value of each BB of every month (The Value of a single BB will be between Rs.1 and Rs.100) and will be announced on or after 25th of the next month. The value of BB will vary every month since it is calculated based on the total commissions received from SHOWROOMS. 
Eg. ILLUSTRATION B: In the first example when the SHOWCASE OWNER paid Rs.20,000 as CASH, he/she is eligible to get 20 BUSINESS BRIDGES(BB’s) in that month.(OSO’s are not eligible for any BRIDGES other than AB) If the value of One BB announced for that particular month is Rs.10, he/she may get a CASH BACK of Rs.200 in his/her BB account. (This BB can be viewed inside LOCKER at the BUSINESS BRIDGES Button) The announced value of BUSINESS BRIDGEs(BB) will be added to calculate their EARNED BRIDGES (EB) of that Month. (The Formula (which is described in detail below) to Calculate EB is EB=Value of BB+CB+DB.) 

CB – COLLECTION BRIDGES (By HANDSHAKE):
HANDSHAKE is a kind of REFERAL program by which VALID SHOWCASE OWNERS can gain COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB). By inviting Friends, Relatives and Colleagues whom you know well via a link inside HANDSHAKE MENU, Members can extend HANDSHAKE to them. When it is accepted by them and signing up via that link to create FREE account (SHOWCASE)inside wolmal.com it is considered as 1 ACTIVE HANDSHAKE (Referral) is completed. A beginner(OSO) who is of age 25 or above when eligible to attend Introductory Selection Training (NSO Training) of 3 hours duration and that NSO-(Normal Showcase Owner) can have up to 100 HANDSHAKES initially. But if he/she is selected to attend RSO (Registered Showcase Owner) Training, and when it is completed successfully, he/she is eligible to do upto 200 Handshakes.  A REGISTERED SHOWCASE OWNER(RSO) when selected to attend CSO (Certified Showcase Owner) Trainings as per wolmal policy and when it is completed successfully, he/she will be announced as CSO and become eligible to do upto 300 HANDSHAKES. Likewise a CSO PLUS(CSO+) Rank Holder is allowed to do 500 Handshakes within 500 days of Installation from the date of EXAMINATION. 
When those Showcase Owners (Technically called as PARTNERS) referred by the Member of wolmal.com via HANDSHAKES  can make BUSINESS BRIDGES (BB) by purchasing  PRODUCTS, the person who did that HANDSHAKE REFERRAL is eligible for 50% of their BUSINESS BRIDGES (BB). These Bridges he/she gained from every HANDSHAKE PARTNER is termed as COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB). (To be eligible for CB, one should have minimum 1 BB in that particular month. CB will be allotted to eligible members for a maximum of continuous 5 years or 60 full calendar months)
Eg. ILLUSTRATION C: Assume that a MEMBER has been selected to attend RSO, CSO & CSO+ training modules and completed successfully to become a CERTIFIED SHOWCASE OWNER PLUS with a “C” displayed along with his/her profile name at MY SHOWCASE PROFILE page AND IF HE/SHE COMPLETED ALL THE ALLOWED 500 ACTIVE HANDSHAKES: Assume as per previous example, he/she purchased 30,000 worth products and paid 20,000 as cash (Balance as AB) and thereby received 20 BB; all his/her referred (ACTIVE HANDSHAKE) 500 members also did the same type of purchase and saved Rs.10,000 and collected 20 BB’s. Now he/she is eligible for 50% of those BB’s as COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB). So from a single member, he/she gets 10CB (50% of 20 BB) and thus a total of 5000 COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB) accrued in that month (500 Members X 10CB = 5000CB). Since the value of BB announced is Rs.10 in that month, the value of CB will also be the same (Wolmal has decided that BB,CB & DB will hold same value in every month. So no need of separate announcement needed) By the above illustration the total amount he/she gain from CB @ Rs.10 for that month is Rs. 50,000. (5000 CB x Rs.10=Rs.50,000) 

DB-DIRECT BRIDGES
 These Bridges are exclusive Bridges alloted by Wolmal directly to FRANCHISES (CENTERS) who have done extra miles for promoting the portal.  DIRECT BRIDGES  are Calculated As 10% of COLLECTION BRIDGES(CB) of all Active Handshakes  Referred By the CENTER OWNER (OSO’s NSO’s, RSO’s, CSO’s & CSO+ are not eligible for DB). Franchise People(CENTER OWNERS) will be trained separately to improve Leadership Skills so as to develop their business by taking care of their partners successfully. They must ensure that their HANDSHAKE PARTNERS get a decent income.
Eg. ILLUSTRATION D: Assume that a Member has been selected as Franchise and all his/her ACTIVE HANDSHAKES are having 100 CB in a particular month, then he/she is eligible for 10% of CB (10% 100 is 10DB) ie. 10 DB from each ACTIVE SHOWCASE OWNER. The value of this DB will also be the same as of the announced value of BB. If he/she is getting 10 DB from 1000 Members (as in the case of a WBC franchise) , then his/her total DB will be 10,000 and if the value of BB announced is just Rs. 10; his/her income from DB will be Rs.1 Lakh (if eligible as per criteria) in that particular month.

EB-EARNED BRIDGES 
The value of Bridges BB,CB,& DB will be calculated and announced on or after 25th of EVERY NEXT MONTH of ACTUAL BUSINESS MONTH in Indian Rupees and will be announced as EARNED BRIDGES (EB) of that SHOWCASE OWNER. The formula to calculate EB is EB=Value of BB+CB+DB.  (The value of One EB will be One INDIAN RUPEE) EB can be redeemed for PRODUCTS from recommended CERTIFIED SHOWROOMS by Qualified SHOWCASE OWNERs. NSO/RSO/CSO/CSO+ & FRANCHISES(CENTERS) can request wolmal to convert EARNED BRIDGES (EB) to Money (CASH in INDIAN CURRENCY through BANK ACCOUNTS-provided BANK ACCOUNT & PAN CARD DETAILS should be furnished in advance) and after deducting Taxes(TDS) as per Government Rules, the Balance will be credited to their Bank account. 
Eg. ILLUSTRATION E: If a CSO PLUS Rank Holder has 20 BB’s, 5000 CB’s (as per all the above examples) and Zero DB’s (only FRANCHISE CENTERS are eligible for DB’s), his/her EB for this month is calculated as follows. The formula to calculate EB is EB=Value of BB+CB+DB. So here value of 20BB has been calculated as Rs.200 and of 5000 CB as 50,000. Hence EB= 200 + 50,000 + 0 = 50,200. As per Rule of Wolmal, a CSO PLUS member is allowed to Earn maximum Rs.50,000 only in a month. So here he/she can request to withdraw upto 50,000 as CASH in that month to his/her Bank Account. The surplus amount of Rs. 200 will go back to WOLMAL.
Eg. ILLUSTRATION E (1) In all the above examples the value of 1 BB is given as Rs.10. If it is announced as Rs.20, the EB has to be calculated as EB=Value of BB+CB+DB. BB=Rs.400, CB= 1,000,00, DB=0. So 400+1,000,00+0=1,00400. Here as per rule, a CSO PLUS is allowed to earn maximum 50,000 only: so the EB credited to his/her account will be 50,000 and the balance will go back to Wolmal. (In these situations Members may apply for FRANCHISE CENTERS to Gain the Full Amount).  To Earn Money, All Members have to inform the bank account details requested and also should fill up PAN Card Number. More over either Passport or Aadhar /Voter ID Number also should be filled in the space provided at Personal Information at MY ACCOUNTS menu.

Here the FRANCHISE GAINS DIRECT BRIDGES WHICH WILL BE 10% OF THE CB OF Active PARTNERS.

Eg. ILLUSTRATION F1: INCOME OF WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER (WBC)
When this Micro Franchise WBC did 1000 Handshakes and all 1000 partners purchase(example) Rs.3000 worth GROCERIES by paying an amount of Rs. 2000 and the balance 1000 paid as AB in this month, all 1000 people and the Franchise owner also gain 2 BB each. So the CB gained by FRANCHISE OWNER will be 1000 (50% of BB of all 1000 ie. 1BB x 1000 =1000 CB). The Franchise is eligible to gain DB also. DB will be 10% of the CB's of all 1000 partners. for example;If the CB of all partners are (example) 100, then FRANCHISE (WBC) is eligible to gain 10% ie 10 DB from each and the total DB will be 10,000 (10x1000=10,000). If the value announced for BB in that month is Rs. 20, the EB will be calculated by the following method. 
EB = VALUE of BB+CB+DB. 
So 2x Rs.20 + 1000 x Rs.20 + 10,000 x Rs. 20= 40 + 20,000 + 2,00,000 = Rs. 2,20,040/-
Since the WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER(WBC) is eligible only for Rs. 2 lakh in a month, the balance Rs.20,040/- will go back to Wolmal and this TWO LAKH will be deposited in his/her EARNED BRIDGES Box and he/she may request Wolmal to credit the amount to the BANK ACCOUNT after deducting TDS. This may continue and every month & the same BUSINESS may happen and can earn the amount every month for UPTO 5 years (60 Months as per agreement). (To gain EARNED BRIDGES in a month, the MEMBER should have at least 1 BB in that particular month.)

And have Managers appointed in every selected Center  to train people on “What to DO?”, “How to Do?” etc and How they can earn (BRIDGES-The currency of wolmal.com) by doing activities every day via SOCIAL NETWORKING at Home as well as Online & OFFLINE Shopping. Wolmal provides FREE Trainings based on merits. 

BRIDGES (The Virtual Currency of wolmal.com)
wolmal.com allows people who have a valid Showcase to participate in the Bridges offer. BRIDGES are GIFTS provided by wolmal.com and  is not a right. By doing pre-defined activities on the wall as well as for Purchase of Products and services from the Certified Showrooms, Members can gain different types of Bridges every day and can be accumulated and then all the different eligible Bridges will be calculated for their values in INDIAN Rupees and converted to EARNED BRIDGES(EB). Purchases can be done online or directly at the shops and can collect BUSINESS BRIDGES (Bridges will be alloted only to Indian citizens who are living in INDIA- To participate in the BRIDGES PROGRAMME, it is mandatory to fill up the detailed personal information requested) By introducing BRIDGES, wolmal.com intends to support actively participating Members to improve their life style not only by making an income at home but also by using HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS. It will boost up the sale of SHOWROOMS and their revenue also will be increased. A portion of the profits on commissions received from them will be shared among the qualified consumers against their BRIDGES. More over a portion of revenue received from ADVERTISEMENTS will also be shared among them as Bridges. 

THERE ARE 5 TYPES OF BRIDGES
1. AB-ACTIVITY BRIDGES 
2. BB-BUSINESS BRIDGES 
3. CB-COLLECTION BRIDGES 
4. DB-DIRECT BRIDGES 
5. EB-EARNED BRIDGES

A considerable percentage of the revenue from Advertisement and Promotions will be calculated yearly/quarterly /monthly or daily and will be shared and is announced as concerned BRIDGES. All these Bridges other than ACTIVITY BRIDGES (AB) together will be calculated and finally announced as EARNED BRIDGES (EB). These EARNED BRIDGES in Indian Rupees can be redeemed for PRODUCTS or can be carry forwarded or otherwise it can be encashed if permitted (as in the case of NSO/RSO/CSO/CSO+ & FRANCHISES) & else can be returned back to WOLMAL .

AB-ACTIVITY BRIDGES 
By doing pre-defined activities on the wall, (Uploading Photos & Albums, doing Comment, Share etc) a valid showcase holder can accrue ACTIVITY BRIDGES. Every day activity inside the wall may ensure good number of ACTIVITY BRIDGES and will be carry forwarded. These Bridges are called Activity Bridges (AB). “What Activities Reward Bridges?” is displayed inside the HELP button of the LOCKER Menu. ACTIVITY BRIDGES (AB) can be utilized along with Money only to purchase products as per wolmal policy.
 Eg. ILLUSTRATION A. An active SHOWCASE OWNER can do prescribed activities and collect upto 250 ACTIVITY BRIDGES as GIFT if he/she try to do all recommended activities everyday without fail. In this way he/she can collect 7500 AB in a month. So by the end of SECOND MONTH he/she will have more than 15000 AB in his/her account.(This can be viewed inside LOCKER  and a detailed list of each micro transaction also can be viewed at TRANSACTIONS Button) The Normal value of 1 Activity Bridge is Rs.1 (One Indian Rupee). So we may say that now he/she has ACTIVITY BRIDGES to the value of Rs.15000/- in his/her account. In this month if he/she wishes to purchase Groceries &other necessary products for his Home from Certified Showrooms & when he/she purchases it as online/offline for a total bill of (say for example) Rs.30,000; as per that month policy of wolmal.com, if he/she has to pay (this is just an example only) only Rs.20,000 as CASH and the balance 10,000 will be deducted by wolmal as ACTIVITY BRIDGES from his/her account. Here the CONSUMER could utilize his 10,000 ACTIVITY BRIDGES instead of paying MONEY. So he/she could SAVE (Saving Money equals Earning Money) Rs.10,000 in that month on purchase of NECESSITY PRODUCTS of every home on every month. In other way we may say that EXPENDITURE BECOME EARNINGS. Now he/she has a balance of 5000 AB in his/her account. When he/she continues to do the activities again in the third month, he/she collects again 7500 AB and the total by the end of that month will be 5000+7500=12,500 ACTIVITY BRIDGES. So again next month also he/she can purchase products as he/she did last month & continuing SAVING MONEY every month by utilizing AB. ACTIVITY BRIDGES CAN NEVER BE CONVERTED AS MONEY.

BB-BUSINESS BRIDGES
When a Showcase Owner having valid Showcase inside wolmal.com purchases products or services from the Certified Showrooms by online/offline, WOLMAL will issue 1 Bridge (BB) for every purchase worth Rs.1000 paid as CASH and this can be accumulated. This Bridge thus accrued by the consumer by PURCHASING PRODUCTS  is termed as BUSINESS BRIDGES (BB). Wolmal will be receiving commissions from those Showrooms for that month and a portion of that amount will be used to calculate the value of each BB of every month (The Value of a single BB will be between Rs.1 and Rs.100) and will be announced on or after 25th of the next month. The value of BB will vary every month since it is calculated based on the total commissions received from SHOWROOMS. 
Eg. ILLUSTRATION B: In the first example when the SHOWCASE OWNER paid Rs.20,000 as CASH, he/she is eligible to get 20 BUSINESS BRIDGES(BB’s) in that month.(OSO’s are not eligible for any BRIDGES other than AB) If the value of One BB announced for that particular month is Rs.10, he/she may get a CASH BACK of Rs.200 in his/her BB account. (This BB can be viewed inside LOCKER at the BUSINESS BRIDGES Button) The announced value of BUSINESS BRIDGEs(BB) will be added to calculate their EARNED BRIDGES (EB) of that Month. (The Formula (which is described in detail below) to Calculate EB is EB=Value of BB+CB+DB.) 

CB – COLLECTION BRIDGES (By HANDSHAKE):
HANDSHAKE is a kind of REFERAL program by which VALID SHOWCASE OWNERS can gain COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB). By inviting Friends, Relatives and Colleagues whom you know well via a link inside HANDSHAKE MENU, Members can extend HANDSHAKE to them. When it is accepted by them and signing up via that link to create FREE account (SHOWCASE)inside wolmal.com it is considered as 1 ACTIVE HANDSHAKE (Referral) is completed. A beginner(OSO) who is of age 25 or above when eligible to attend Introductory Selection Training (NSO Training) of 3 hours duration and that NSO-(Normal Showcase Owner) can have up to 100 HANDSHAKES initially. But if he/she is selected to attend RSO (Registered Showcase Owner) Training, and when it is completed successfully, he/she is eligible to do upto 200 Handshakes.  A REGISTERED SHOWCASE OWNER(RSO) when selected to attend CSO (Certified Showcase Owner) Trainings as per wolmal policy and when it is completed successfully, he/she will be announced as CSO and become eligible to do upto 300 HANDSHAKES. Likewise a CSO PLUS(CSO+) Rank Holder is allowed to do 500 Handshakes within 500 days of Installation from the date of EXAMINATION. 
When those Showcase Owners (Technically called as PARTNERS) referred by the Member of wolmal.com via HANDSHAKES  can make BUSINESS BRIDGES (BB) by purchasing  PRODUCTS, the person who did that HANDSHAKE REFERRAL is eligible for 50% of their BUSINESS BRIDGES (BB). These Bridges he/she gained from every HANDSHAKE PARTNER is termed as COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB). (To be eligible for CB, one should have minimum 1 BB in that particular month. CB will be allotted to eligible members for a maximum of continuous 5 years or 60 full calendar months)
Eg. ILLUSTRATION C: Assume that a MEMBER has been selected to attend RSO, CSO & CSO+ training modules and completed successfully to become a CERTIFIED SHOWCASE OWNER PLUS with a “C” displayed along with his/her profile name at MY SHOWCASE PROFILE page AND IF HE/SHE COMPLETED ALL THE ALLOWED 500 ACTIVE HANDSHAKES: Assume as per previous example, he/she purchased 30,000 worth products and paid 20,000 as cash (Balance as AB) and thereby received 20 BB; all his/her referred (ACTIVE HANDSHAKE) 500 members also did the same type of purchase and saved Rs.10,000 and collected 20 BB’s. Now he/she is eligible for 50% of those BB’s as COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB). So from a single member, he/she gets 10CB (50% of 20 BB) and thus a total of 5000 COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB) accrued in that month (500 Members X 10CB = 5000CB). Since the value of BB announced is Rs.10 in that month, the value of CB will also be the same (Wolmal has decided that BB,CB & DB will hold same value in every month. So no need of separate announcement needed) By the above illustration the total amount he/she gain from CB @ Rs.10 for that month is Rs. 50,000. (5000 CB x Rs.10=Rs.50,000) 

DB-DIRECT BRIDGES
 These Bridges are exclusive Bridges alloted by Wolmal directly to FRANCHISES (CENTERS) who have done extra miles for promoting the portal.  DIRECT BRIDGES  are Calculated As 10% of COLLECTION BRIDGES(CB) of all Active Handshakes  Referred By the CENTER OWNER (OSO’s NSO’s, RSO’s, CSO’s & CSO+ are not eligible for DB). Franchise People(CENTER OWNERS) will be trained separately to improve Leadership Skills so as to develop their business by taking care of their partners successfully. They must ensure that their HANDSHAKE PARTNERS get a decent income.
Eg. ILLUSTRATION D: Assume that a Member has been selected as Franchise and all his/her ACTIVE HANDSHAKES are having 100 CB in a particular month, then he/she is eligible for 10% of CB (10% 100 is 10DB) ie. 10 DB from each ACTIVE SHOWCASE OWNER. The value of this DB will also be the same as of the announced value of BB. If he/she is getting 10 DB from 1000 Members (as in the case of a WBC franchise) , then his/her total DB will be 10,000 and if the value of BB announced is just Rs. 10; his/her income from DB will be Rs.1 Lakh (if eligible as per criteria) in that particular month.

EB-EARNED BRIDGES 
The value of Bridges BB,CB,& DB will be calculated and announced on or after 25th of EVERY NEXT MONTH of ACTUAL BUSINESS MONTH in Indian Rupees and will be announced as EARNED BRIDGES (EB) of that SHOWCASE OWNER. The formula to calculate EB is EB=Value of BB+CB+DB.  (The value of One EB will be One INDIAN RUPEE) EB can be redeemed for PRODUCTS from recommended CERTIFIED SHOWROOMS by Qualified SHOWCASE OWNERs. NSO/RSO/CSO/CSO+ & FRANCHISES(CENTERS) can request wolmal to convert EARNED BRIDGES (EB) to Money (CASH in INDIAN CURRENCY through BANK ACCOUNTS-provided BANK ACCOUNT & PAN CARD DETAILS should be furnished in advance) and after deducting Taxes(TDS) as per Government Rules, the Balance will be credited to their Bank account. 
Eg. ILLUSTRATION E: If a CSO PLUS Rank Holder has 20 BB’s, 5000 CB’s (as per all the above examples) and Zero DB’s (only FRANCHISE CENTERS are eligible for DB’s), his/her EB for this month is calculated as follows. The formula to calculate EB is EB=Value of BB+CB+DB. So here value of 20BB has been calculated as Rs.200 and of 5000 CB as 50,000. Hence EB= 200 + 50,000 + 0 = 50,200. As per Rule of Wolmal, a CSO PLUS member is allowed to Earn maximum Rs.50,000 only in a month. So here he/she can request to withdraw upto 50,000 as CASH in that month to his/her Bank Account. The surplus amount of Rs. 200 will go back to WOLMAL.
Eg. ILLUSTRATION E (1) In all the above examples the value of 1 BB is given as Rs.10. If it is announced as Rs.20, the EB has to be calculated as EB=Value of BB+CB+DB. BB=Rs.400, CB= 1,000,00, DB=0. So 400+1,000,00+0=1,00400. Here as per rule, a CSO PLUS is allowed to earn maximum 50,000 only: so the EB credited to his/her account will be 50,000 and the balance will go back to Wolmal. (In these situations Members may apply for FRANCHISE CENTERS to Gain the Full Amount).  To Earn Money, All Members have to inform the bank account details requested and also should fill up PAN Card Number. More over either Passport or Aadhar /Voter ID Number also should be filled in the space provided at Personal Information at MY ACCOUNTS menu.

2 TYPES of MICRO FRANCHISES.
(1)  WOLMAL AFFILIATE CENTER (WAC) 
(2)  WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER (WBC)

WOLMAL AFFILIATE CENTER (WAC):
 Allowed to do upto 500 HANDSHAKES within the agreement period of 5 Years(60 Months) and the Maximum Income Limit in a month will be Rs. 1 lakh. The AFFILIATE CENTER is authorised to train and motivate all these 500 PARTNERS to collect their AB, BB & CB and to make sure that they earn a decent income as per their criteria. 
Here the FRANCHISE GAINS DIRECT BRIDGES WHICH WILL BE 10% OF THE CB OF Active PARTNERS.

WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER (WBC): 
Allowed to do upto 1000 HANDSHAKES within the agreement period of 5 Years(60 Months) and the Maximum Income Limit in a month will be Rs. 2 lakh. The BUSINESS CENTER is authorised to train and motivate all these 1000 PARTNERS to collect their AB, BB & CB and to make sure that they earn a decent income as per their criteria. 
Here the FRANCHISE GAINS DIRECT BRIDGES WHICH WILL BE 10% OF THE CB OF Active PARTNERS.

Eg. ILLUSTRATION F1: INCOME OF WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER (WBC)
When this Micro Franchise WBC did 1000 Handshakes and all 1000 partners purchase(example) Rs.3000 worth GROCERIES by paying an amount of Rs. 2000 and the balance 1000 paid as AB in this month, all 1000 people and the Franchise owner also gain 2 BB each. So the CB gained by FRANCHISE OWNER will be 1000 (50% of BB of all 1000 ie. 1BB x 1000 =1000 CB). The Franchise is eligible to gain DB also. DB will be 10% of the CB's of all 1000 partners. for example;If the CB of all partners are (example) 100, then FRANCHISE (WBC) is eligible to gain 10% ie 10 DB from each and the total DB will be 10,000 (10x1000=10,000). If the value announced for BB in that month is Rs. 20, the EB will be calculated by the following method. 
EB = VALUE of BB+CB+DB. 
So 2x Rs.20 + 1000 x Rs.20 + 10,000 x Rs. 20= 40 + 20,000 + 2,00,000 = Rs. 2,20,040/-
Since the WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER(WBC) is eligible only for Rs. 2 lakh in a month, the balance Rs.20,040/- will go back to Wolmal and this TWO LAKH will be deposited in his/her EARNED BRIDGES Box and he/she may request Wolmal to credit the amount to the BANK ACCOUNT after deducting TDS. This may continue and every month & the same BUSINESS may happen and can earn the amount every month for UPTO 5 years (60 Months as per agreement). (To gain EARNED BRIDGES in a month, the MEMBER should have at least 1 BB in that particular month.)

In other way we may say that EXPENDITURE BECOME EARNINGS. Now he/she has a balance of 29,000 AB in his/her account. When he/she continues to do the activities again in the third month, he/she collects again 15000 or above AB and the total by the end of that month will be 15000+29000=44,000 ACTIVITY BRIDGES. So again next month also he/she can purchase products as he/she did last month & continuing SAVING MONEY every month by utilizing AB. ACTIVITY BRIDGES CAN NEVER BE CONVERTED AS MONEY.

BB-BUSINESS BRIDGES
When a Showcase Owner having valid Showcase inside wolmal.com purchases products or services from the Certified Showrooms by online/offline, WOLMAL will issue 1 Business Bridge (BB) for every purchase worth Rs.1000 paid as CASH and this can be accumulated. This Bridge thus accrued by the consumer by PURCHASING PRODUCTS  is termed as BUSINESS BRIDGES (BB). Wolmal will be receiving commissions from those Showrooms for that month and a portion of that amount will be used to calculate the value of each BB of every month (The Value of a single BB will be between Rs.25 and Rs.100) and will be announced on or after 25th of the next month. The value of BB will vary every month based on the Business.
Eg. ILLUSTRATION B: In the first example when the SHOWCASE OWNER paid Rs.20,000 as CASH, he/she is eligible to get 20 BUSINESS BRIDGES(BB’s) in that month.(OSO’s are not eligible for any BRIDGES other than AB) If the value of One BB announced for that particular month is Rs.50, he/she may get a CASH BACK of Rs.200 in his/her BB account. (This BB can be viewed inside LOCKER at the BUSINESS BRIDGES Button) The announced value of BUSINESS BRIDGEs(BB) will be added to calculate their EARNED BRIDGES (EB) of that Month. (The Formula (which is described in detail below) to Calculate EB is EB=Value of BB+CB+DB.) 

CB – COLLECTION BRIDGES (By HANDSHAKE):
HANDSHAKE is a kind of REFERAL program by which VALID SHOWCASE OWNERS can gain COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB). By inviting Friends, Relatives and Colleagues whom you know well via a link inside HANDSHAKE MENU, Members can extend HANDSHAKE to them. When it is accepted by them and signing up via that link to create FREE account (SHOWCASE)inside wolmal.com it is considered as 1 ACTIVE HANDSHAKE (Referral) is completed. A beginner(OSO) who is of age 25 or above when eligible to attend Introductory Selection Training (NSO Training) of 3 hours duration and that NSO-(Normal Showcase Owner) can have up to 100 HANDSHAKES initially. But if he/she is selected to attend RSO (Registered Showcase Owner) Training, and when it is completed successfully, he/she is eligible to do upto 200 Handshakes.  A REGISTERED SHOWCASE OWNER(RSO) when selected to attend CSO (Certified Showcase Owner) Trainings as per wolmal policy and when it is completed successfully, he/she will be announced as CSO and become eligible to do upto 300 HANDSHAKES. Likewise a CSO PLUS(CSO+) Rank Holder is allowed to do 500 Handshakes within 500 days of Installation from the date of EXAMINATION. 
When those Showcase Owners (Technically called as PARTNERS) referred by the Member of wolmal.com via HANDSHAKES  can make BUSINESS BRIDGES (BB) by purchasing  PRODUCTS, the person who did that HANDSHAKE REFERRAL is eligible for 50% of their BUSINESS BRIDGES (BB). These Bridges he/she gained from every HANDSHAKE PARTNER is termed as COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB). (To be eligible for CB, one should have minimum 1 BB in that particular month. CB will be allotted to eligible members for a maximum of continuous 5 years or 60 full calendar months)
Eg. ILLUSTRATION C: Assume that a MEMBER has been selected to attend RSO, CSO & CSO+ training modules and completed successfully to become a CERTIFIED SHOWCASE OWNER PLUS with a “C” displayed along with his/her profile name at MY SHOWCASE PROFILE page AND IF HE/SHE COMPLETED ALL THE ALLOWED 500 ACTIVE HANDSHAKES: Assume as per previous example, he/she purchased 30,000 worth products and paid 20,000 as cash (Balance as AB) and thereby received 20 BB; all his/her referred (ACTIVE HANDSHAKE) 500 members also did the same type of purchase and saved Rs.10,000 and collected 20 BB’s. Now he/she is eligible for 50% of those BB’s as COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB). So from a single member, he/she gets 10CB (50% of 20 BB) and thus a total of 5000 COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB) accrued in that month (500 Members X 10CB = 5000CB). Since the value of BB announced is Rs.10 in that month, the value of CB will also be the same (Wolmal has decided that BB,CB & DB will hold same value in every month. So no need of separate announcement needed) By the above illustration the total amount he/she gain from CB @ Rs.10 for that month is Rs. 50,000. (5000 CB x Rs.10=Rs.50,000) 

DB-DIRECT BRIDGES
 These Bridges are exclusive Bridges alloted by Wolmal directly to FRANCHISES (CENTERS) who have done extra miles for promoting the portal.  DIRECT BRIDGES  are Calculated As 10% of COLLECTION BRIDGES(CB) of all Active Handshakes  Referred By the CENTER OWNER (OSO’s NSO’s, RSO’s, CSO’s & CSO+ are not eligible for DB). Franchise People(CENTER OWNERS) will be trained separately to improve Leadership Skills so as to develop their business by taking care of their partners successfully. They must ensure that their HANDSHAKE PARTNERS get a decent income.
Eg. ILLUSTRATION D: Assume that a Member has been selected as Franchise and all his/her ACTIVE HANDSHAKES are having 100 CB in a particular month, then he/she is eligible for 10% of CB (10% 100 is 10DB) ie. 10 DB from each ACTIVE SHOWCASE OWNER. The value of this DB will also be the same as of the announced value of BB. If he/she is getting 10 DB from 1000 Members (as in the case of a WBC franchise) , then his/her total DB will be 10,000 and if the value of BB announced is just Rs. 10; his/her income from DB will be Rs.1 Lakh (if eligible as per criteria) in that particular month.

EB-EARNED BRIDGES 
The value of Bridges BB,CB,& DB will be calculated and announced on or after 25th of EVERY NEXT MONTH of ACTUAL BUSINESS MONTH in Indian Rupees and will be announced as EARNED BRIDGES (EB) of that SHOWCASE OWNER. The formula to calculate EB is EB=Value of BB+CB+DB.  (The value of One EB will be One INDIAN RUPEE) EB can be redeemed for PRODUCTS from recommended CERTIFIED SHOWROOMS by Qualified SHOWCASE OWNERs. NSO/RSO/CSO/CSO+ & FRANCHISES(CENTERS) can request wolmal to convert EARNED BRIDGES (EB) to Money (CASH in INDIAN CURRENCY through BANK ACCOUNTS-provided BANK ACCOUNT & PAN CARD DETAILS should be furnished in advance) and after deducting Taxes(TDS) as per Government Rules, the Balance will be credited to their Bank account. 
Eg. ILLUSTRATION E: If a CSO PLUS Rank Holder has 20 BB’s, 5000 CB’s (as per all the above examples) and Zero DB’s (only FRANCHISE CENTERS are eligible for DB’s), his/her EB for this month is calculated as follows. The formula to calculate EB is EB=Value of BB+CB+DB. So here value of 20BB has been calculated as Rs.200 and of 5000 CB as 50,000. Hence EB= 200 + 50,000 + 0 = 50,200. As per Rule of Wolmal, a CSO PLUS member is allowed to Earn maximum Rs.50,000 only in a month. So here he/she can request to withdraw upto 50,000 as CASH in that month to his/her Bank Account. The surplus amount of Rs. 200 will go back to WOLMAL.
Eg. ILLUSTRATION E (1) In all the above examples the value of 1 BB is given as Rs.10. If it is announced as Rs.20, the EB has to be calculated as EB=Value of BB+CB+DB. BB=Rs.400, CB= 1,000,00, DB=0. So 400+1,000,00+0=1,00400. Here as per rule, a CSO PLUS is allowed to earn maximum 50,000 only: so the EB credited to his/her account will be 50,000 and the balance will go back to Wolmal. (In these situations Members may apply for FRANCHISE CENTERS to Gain the Full Amount).  To Earn Money, All Members have to inform the bank account details requested and also should fill up PAN Card Number. More over either Passport or Aadhar /Voter ID Number also should be filled in the space provided at Personal Information at MY ACCOUNTS menu.

MICRO FRANCHISEs: 
CAN START AT HOME.   At least A TABLE SPACE IS REQUIRED.
2 TYPES of MICRO FRANCHISES.
(1)  WOLMAL AFFILIATE CENTER (WAC) 
(2)  WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER (WBC)

WOLMAL AFFILIATE CENTER (WAC):
 Allowed to do upto 500 HANDSHAKES within the agreement period of 5 Years(60 Months) and the Maximum Income Limit in a month will be Rs. 1 lakh. The AFFILIATE CENTER is authorised to train and motivate all these 500 PARTNERS to collect their AB, BB & CB and to make sure that they earn a decent income as per their criteria. 
Here the FRANCHISE GAINS DIRECT BRIDGES WHICH WILL BE 10% OF THE CB OF Active PARTNERS.

WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER (WBC): 
Allowed to do upto 1000 HANDSHAKES within the agreement period of 5 Years(60 Months) and the Maximum Income Limit in a month will be Rs. 2 lakh. The BUSINESS CENTER is authorised to train and motivate all these 1000 PARTNERS to collect their AB, BB & CB and to make sure that they earn a decent income as per their criteria. 
Here the FRANCHISE GAINS DIRECT BRIDGES WHICH WILL BE 10% OF THE CB OF Active PARTNERS.

Eg. ILLUSTRATION F1: INCOME OF WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER (WBC)
When this Micro Franchise WBC did 1000 Handshakes and all 1000 partners purchase(example) Rs.3000 worth GROCERIES by paying an amount of Rs. 2000 and the balance 1000 paid as AB in this month, all 1000 people and the Franchise owner also gain 2 BB each. So the CB gained by FRANCHISE OWNER will be 1000 (50% of BB of all 1000 ie. 1BB x 1000 =1000 CB). The Franchise is eligible to gain DB also. DB will be 10% of the CB's of all 1000 partners. for example;If the CB of all partners are (example) 100, then FRANCHISE (WBC) is eligible to gain 10% ie 10 DB from each and the total DB will be 10,000 (10x1000=10,000). If the value announced for BB in that month is Rs. 20, the EB will be calculated by the following method. 
EB = VALUE of BB+CB+DB. 
So 2x Rs.20 + 1000 x Rs.20 + 10,000 x Rs. 20= 40 + 20,000 + 2,00,000 = Rs. 2,20,040/-
Since the WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER(WBC) is eligible only for Rs. 2 lakh in a month, the balance Rs.20,040/- will go back to Wolmal and this TWO LAKH will be deposited in his/her EARNED BRIDGES Box and he/she may request Wolmal to credit the amount to the BANK ACCOUNT after deducting TDS. This may continue and every month & the same BUSINESS may happen and can earn the amount every month for UPTO 5 years (60 Months as per agreement). (To gain EARNED BRIDGES in a month, the MEMBER should have at least 1 BB in that particular month.)

BRIDGES (The Virtual Currency of wolmal.com)
wolmal.com allows people who have a valid Showcase to participate in the Bridges offer. BRIDGES are GIFTS provided by wolmal.com and  is not a right. By doing pre-defined activities on the wall as well as for Purchase of Products and services from the Certified Showrooms, Members can gain different types of Bridges every day and can be accumulated and then all the different eligible Bridges will be calculated for their values and converted to EARNED BRIDGES(EB).

THERE ARE 5 TYPES OF BRIDGES
1. AB-ACTIVITY BRIDGES 
2. BB-BUSINESS BRIDGES 
3. CB-COLLECTION BRIDGES 
4. DB-DIRECT BRIDGES 
5. EB-EARNED BRIDGES

A considerable percentage of the revenue from Advertisement and Promotions will be calculated yearly/quarterly /monthly or daily and will be shared and is announced as concerned BRIDGES. All these Bridges other than ACTIVITY BRIDGES (AB) together will be calculated and finally announced as EARNED BRIDGES (EB). These EARNED BRIDGES in Indian Rupees can be redeemed for PRODUCTS or can be carry forwarded or otherwise it can be encashed if permitted (as in the case of NSO/RSO/CSO/CSO+ & FRANCHISES) & else can be returned back to WOLMAL .

AB-ACTIVITY BRIDGES 
By doing pre-defined activities on the wall, (Uploading Photos & Albums, doing Comment, Share etc) a valid showcase holder can accrue ACTIVITY BRIDGES. Every day activity inside the wall may ensure good number of ACTIVITY BRIDGES and will be carry forwarded. These Bridges are called Activity Bridges (AB). “What Activities Reward Bridges?” is displayed inside the HELP button of the LOCKER Menu. ACTIVITY BRIDGES (AB) can be utilized along with Money only to purchase products as per wolmal policy.
 Eg. ILLUSTRATION A. An active SHOWCASE OWNER can do prescribed activities and collect above 500 ACTIVITY BRIDGES as GIFT, if he/she try to do all recommended activities everyday without fail. In this way he/she can collect 15000 or above AB in a month. So by the end of SECOND MONTH he/she will have more than 30,000 AB in his/her account.(This can be viewed inside LOCKER  and a detailed list of each micro transaction also can be viewed at TRANSACTIONS Button) The Normal value of 1 Activity Bridge is Rs.1 (One Indian Rupee). So we may say that now he/she has ACTIVITY BRIDGES to the value of Rs.30,000/- in his/her account. In this month if he/she wishes to purchase Groceries & other necessary products for his Home from Certified Showrooms & when he/she purchases it as online/offline for a total bill of (say for example) Rs.3,000; as per that month policy of wolmal.com, if he/she has to pay (this is just an example only) only Rs.2,000 as CASH and the balance 1,000 will be deducted by wolmal as ACTIVITY BRIDGES from his/her account. Here the CONSUMER could utilize his 1,000 ACTIVITY BRIDGES instead of paying MONEY. So he/she could SAVE (Saving Money equals Earning Money) Rs.1,000 in that month on purchase of NECESSITY PRODUCTS of every home on every month. In other way we may say that EXPENDITURE BECOME EARNINGS. Now he/she has a balance of 29,000 AB in his/her account. When he/she continues to do the activities again in the third month, he/she collects again 15000 or above AB and the total by the end of that month will be 15000+29000=44,000 ACTIVITY BRIDGES. So again next month also he/she can purchase products as he/she did last month & continuing SAVING MONEY every month by utilizing AB. ACTIVITY BRIDGES CAN NEVER BE CONVERTED AS MONEY.

BB-BUSINESS BRIDGES
When a Showcase Owner having valid Showcase inside wolmal.com purchases products or services from the Certified Showrooms by online/offline, WOLMAL will issue 1 Business Bridge (BB) for every purchase worth Rs.1000 paid as CASH and this can be accumulated. This Bridge thus accrued by the consumer by PURCHASING PRODUCTS  is termed as BUSINESS BRIDGES (BB). Wolmal will be receiving commissions from those Showrooms for that month and a portion of that amount will be used to calculate the value of each BB of every month (The Value of a single BB will be between Rs.25 and Rs.100) and will be announced on or after 25th of the next month. The value of BB will vary every month based on the Business.
Eg. ILLUSTRATION B: In the first example when the SHOWCASE OWNER paid Rs.2000 as CASH, he/she is eligible to get 2 BUSINESS BRIDGES(BB’s) in that month.(OSO’s are not eligible for any BRIDGES other than AB) If the value of One BB announced for that particular month is Rs.50, he/she may get a CASH BACK of Rs.100 in his/her BB account. (This BB can be viewed inside LOCKER/VALLET at the BUSINESS BRIDGES Button) The announced value of BUSINESS BRIDGEs(BB) will be added to calculate their EARNED BRIDGES (EB) of that Month. (The Formula (which is described in detail below) to Calculate EB is EB=Value of BB+CB+DB.) 

CB – COLLECTION BRIDGES (By HANDSHAKE):
HANDSHAKE is a kind of REFERAL program by which VALID SHOWCASE OWNERS can gain COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB). By inviting Friends, Relatives and Colleagues whom you know well via a link inside HANDSHAKE MENU, Members can extend HANDSHAKE to them. When it is accepted by them and signing up via that link to create FREE account (SHOWCASE)inside wolmal.com it is considered as 1 ACTIVE HANDSHAKE (Referral) is completed. A beginner(OSO) who is of age 25 or above when eligible to attend Introductory Selection Training (NSO Training) of 3 hours duration and that NSO-(Normal Showcase Owner) can have up to 100 HANDSHAKES initially. But if he/she is selected to attend RSO (Registered Showcase Owner) Training, and when it is completed successfully, he/she is eligible to do upto 200 Handshakes.  A REGISTERED SHOWCASE OWNER(RSO) when selected to attend CSO (Certified Showcase Owner) Trainings as per wolmal policy and when it is completed successfully, he/she will be announced as CSO and become eligible to do upto 300 HANDSHAKES. Likewise a CSO PLUS(CSO+) Rank Holder is allowed to do 500 Handshakes within 500 days of Installation from the date of EXAMINATION/ANNOUNCEMENT. 
When those Showcase Owners (Technically called as PARTNERS) referred by the Member of wolmal.com via HANDSHAKES can make BUSINESS BRIDGES (BB) by purchasing  PRODUCTS, the person who did that HANDSHAKE REFERRAL is eligible for 50% of their BUSINESS BRIDGES (BB). These Bridges he/she gained from every HANDSHAKE PARTNER is termed as COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB). (To be eligible for CB, one should have minimum 2 BB in that particular month. CB will be allotted to eligible members for a maximum of continuous 10 years or 120 full calendar months)
Eg. ILLUSTRATION C: Assume that a MEMBER has been selected to attend RSO, CSO & CSO+ training modules and completed successfully to become a CERTIFIED CORE SHOWCASE OWNER PLUS with a “C” displayed along with his/her profile name at MY SHOWCASE PROFILE page AND IF HE/SHE COMPLETED ALL THE ALLOWED 500 ACTIVE HANDSHAKES: Assume as per previous example, he/she purchased 3000 worth products and paid Rs. 2,000 as cash (Balance as AB) and thereby received 2 BB; LET US ASSUME all his/her referred (ACTIVE HANDSHAKE) 500 members also did the same type of purchase and saved Rs.1000 and collected 2 BB’s. Now he/she is eligible for 50% of those BB’s as COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB). So from a single member, he/she gets 1CB (50% of 2 BB) and thus a total of 500 COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB) accrued in that month (500 Members X 1CB = 500CB). Since the value of BB announced is Rs.50 in that month, the value of CB will also be the same (Wolmal has decided that BB,CB & DB will hold same value in every month. So no need of separate announcement) By the above illustration the total amount he/she gain from CB @ Rs.50 for that month is Rs. 25,000. (500 CB x Rs.50=Rs.25,000) 

DB-DIRECT BRIDGES
 These Bridges are exclusive Bridges allotted by Wolmal directly to FRANCHISES (CENTERS) who have done extra miles for promoting the portal.  DIRECT BRIDGES  are Calculated As 10% to 50% of COLLECTION BRIDGES(CB) of all Active Handshakes  Referred By the CENTER OWNER (OSO’s NSO’s, RSO’s, CSO’s & CSO+ are not eligible for DB). Franchise People(CENTER OWNERS) will be trained separately to improve Leadership Skills so as to develop their business by taking care of their partners successfully. They must ensure that their HANDSHAKE PARTNERS get a decent income.
Eg. ILLUSTRATION D: Assume that a Member has been selected as Franchise and all his/her ACTIVE HANDSHAKES are having 100 CB in a particular month, then he/she is eligible for a minimum of 10% of CB (10% 100 is 10DB) ie. 10 DB from each ACTIVE SHOWCASE OWNER. The value of this DB will also be the same as of the announced value of BB. If he/she is getting 10 DB from 100 CONSUMERS, then his/her total DB will be 1000 and if the value of BB announced is just Rs. 50; his/her income from DB will be Rs.50,000 (if eligible as per FRANCHISE RANKING criteria) in that particular month.

EB-EARNED BRIDGES 
The value of Bridges BB,CB,& DB will be calculated and announced on or after 25th of EVERY NEXT MONTH of ACTUAL BUSINESS MONTH in Indian Rupees and will be announced as EARNED BRIDGES (EB) of that SHOWCASE OWNER. The formula to calculate EB is EB=Value of BB+CB+DB.  (The value of One EB will be One INDIAN RUPEE) EB can be redeemed for PRODUCTS from recommended CERTIFIED SHOWROOMS by Qualified SHOWCASE OWNERs. ELIGIBLE NSO/RSO/CSO/CSO+ & FRANCHISES(CENTERS) can request wolmal to convert ELIGIBLE EARNED BRIDGES (EB) to Money (CASH in INDIAN CURRENCY through BANK ACCOUNTS-provided BANK ACCOUNT & PAN CARD DETAILS should be furnished in advance) and after deducting Taxes(TDS) as per Government Rules, the Balance will be credited to their Bank account. 
Eg. ILLUSTRATION E: If a CSO PLUS Rank Holder has 20 BB’s, 500 CB’s  and Zero DB’s (only FRANCHISE CENTERS are eligible for DB’s), his/her EB for this month is calculated as follows. The formula to calculate EB is EB=Value of BB+CB+DB. So here value of 20BB has been calculated as Rs.1000 and of 500 CB as 25,000. Hence EB= 1000 + 25,000 + 0 = 26,000. As per Rule of Wolmal, a CSO PLUS member is allowed to Earn maximum Rs.50,000 only in a month. 
Eg. ILLUSTRATION E (1) In all the above examples the value of 1 BB is given as Rs.50. If it is announced as Rs.100, the EB has to be calculated as EB=Value of BB+CB+DB. BB=Rs.2000, CB= 50,000, DB=0. So 2000+50,000+0=52,000. Here as per rule, a CSO PLUS is allowed to earn maximum 50,000 only: so the EB credited to his/her account will be 50,000 and the balance will go back to Wolmal. (In these situations Members may apply for FRANCHISE CENTERS to Gain the Full Amount).  To Earn Money, All Members have to inform the bank account details requested and also should fill up PAN Card Number.

2 TYPES of MICRO FRANCHISES.
(1)  WOLMAL AFFILIATE CENTER (WAC) 
(2)  WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER (WBC)

WOLMAL AFFILIATE CENTER (WAC):
 Allowed to do upto 500 HANDSHAKES within the agreement period of 5 Years(60 Months) and the Maximum Income Limit in a month will be Rs. 1 lakh. The AFFILIATE CENTER is authorised to train and motivate all these 500 PARTNERS to collect their AB, BB & CB and to make sure that they earn a decent income as per their criteria. 
Here the FRANCHISE GAINS DIRECT BRIDGES WHICH WILL BE 10% OF THE CB OF Active PARTNERS.

WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER (WBC): 
Allowed to do upto 1000 HANDSHAKES within the agreement period of 5 Years(60 Months) and the Maximum Income Limit in a month will be Rs. 2 lakh. The BUSINESS CENTER is authorised to train and motivate all these 1000 PARTNERS to collect their AB, BB & CB and to make sure that they earn a decent income as per their criteria. 
Here the FRANCHISE GAINS DIRECT BRIDGES WHICH WILL BE 10% OF THE CB OF Active PARTNERS.

Eg. ILLUSTRATION F1: INCOME OF WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER (WBC)
When this Micro Franchise WBC did 1000 Handshakes and all 1000 partners purchase(example) Rs.3000 worth GROCERIES by paying an amount of Rs. 2000 and the balance 1000 paid as AB in this month, all 1000 people and the Franchise owner also gain 2 BB each. So the CB gained by FRANCHISE OWNER will be 1000 (50% of BB of all 1000 ie. 1BB x 1000 =1000 CB). The Franchise is eligible to gain DB also. DB will be 10% of the CB's of all 1000 partners. for example;If the CB of all partners are (example) 100, then FRANCHISE (WBC) is eligible to gain 10% ie 10 DB from each and the total DB will be 10,000 (10x1000=10,000). If the value announced for BB in that month is Rs. 20, the EB will be calculated by the following method. 
EB = VALUE of BB+CB+DB. 
So 2x Rs.20 + 1000 x Rs.20 + 10,000 x Rs. 20= 40 + 20,000 + 2,00,000 = Rs. 2,20,040/-
Since the WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER(WBC) is eligible only for Rs. 2 lakh in a month, the balance Rs.20,040/- will go back to Wolmal and this TWO LAKH will be deposited in his/her EARNED BRIDGES Box and he/she may request Wolmal to credit the amount to the BANK ACCOUNT after deducting TDS. This may continue and every month & the same BUSINESS may happen and can earn the amount every month for UPTO 5 years (60 Months as per agreement). (To gain EARNED BRIDGES in a month, the MEMBER should have at least 1 BB in that particular month.)

Wolmal provides FREE Trainings based on merits. 

BRIDGES (The Virtual Currency of wolmal.com)
wolmal.com allows people who have a valid Showcase to participate in the Bridges offer. BRIDGES are GIFTS provided by wolmal.com and  is not a right. By doing pre-defined activities on the wall as well as for Purchase of Products and services from the Certified Showrooms, Members can gain different types of Bridges every day and can be accumulated and then all the different eligible Bridges will be calculated for their values and converted to EARNED BRIDGES(EB). Purchases can be done online or directly at the shops and can collect BUSINESS BRIDGES (Bridges will be alloted only to Indian citizens who are living in INDIA- To participate in the BRIDGES PROGRAMME, it is mandatory to fill up the detailed personal information requested) By introducing BRIDGES, wolmal.com intends to support actively participating Members to improve their life style not only by making an income at home but also by using HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS. It will boost up the sale of SHOWROOMS and their revenue also will be increased. A portion of the profits on commissions received from them will be shared among the qualified consumers against their BRIDGES. More over a portion of revenue received from ADVERTISEMENTS will also be shared among them as Bridges. 

THERE ARE 5 TYPES OF BRIDGES
1. AB-ACTIVITY BRIDGES 
2. BB-BUSINESS BRIDGES 
3. CB-COLLECTION BRIDGES 
4. DB-DIRECT BRIDGES 
5. EB-EARNED BRIDGES

A considerable percentage of the revenue from Advertisement and Promotions will be calculated yearly/quarterly /monthly or daily and will be shared and is announced as concerned BRIDGES. All these Bridges other than ACTIVITY BRIDGES (AB) together will be calculated and finally announced as EARNED BRIDGES (EB). These EARNED BRIDGES in Indian Rupees can be redeemed for PRODUCTS or can be carry forwarded or otherwise it can be encashed if permitted (as in the case of NSO/RSO/CSO/CSO+ & FRANCHISES) & else can be returned back to WOLMAL .

AB-ACTIVITY BRIDGES 
By doing pre-defined activities on the wall, (Uploading Photos & Albums, doing Comment, Share etc) a valid showcase holder can accrue ACTIVITY BRIDGES. Every day activity inside the wall may ensure good number of ACTIVITY BRIDGES and will be carry forwarded. These Bridges are called Activity Bridges (AB). “What Activities Reward Bridges?” is displayed inside the HELP button of the LOCKER Menu. ACTIVITY BRIDGES (AB) can be utilized along with Money only to purchase products as per wolmal policy.
 Eg. ILLUSTRATION A. An active SHOWCASE OWNER can do prescribed activities and collect above 500 ACTIVITY BRIDGES as GIFT, if he/she try to do all recommended activities everyday without fail. In this way he/she can collect 15000 or above AB in a month. So by the end of SECOND MONTH he/she will have more than 30,000 AB in his/her account.(This can be viewed inside LOCKER  and a detailed list of each micro transaction also can be viewed at TRANSACTIONS Button) The Normal value of 1 Activity Bridge is Rs.1 (One Indian Rupee). So we may say that now he/she has ACTIVITY BRIDGES to the value of Rs.30,000/- in his/her account. In this month if he/she wishes to purchase Groceries & other necessary products for his Home from Certified Showrooms & when he/she purchases it as online/offline for a total bill of (say for example) Rs.3,000; as per that month policy of wolmal.com, if he/she has to pay (this is just an example only) only Rs.2,000 as CASH and the balance 1,000 will be deducted by wolmal as ACTIVITY BRIDGES from his/her account. Here the CONSUMER could utilize his 1,000 ACTIVITY BRIDGES instead of paying MONEY. So he/she could SAVE (Saving Money equals Earning Money) Rs.1,000 in that month on purchase of NECESSITY PRODUCTS of every home on every month. In other way we may say that EXPENDITURE BECOME EARNINGS. Now he/she has a balance of 29,000 AB in his/her account. When he/she continues to do the activities again in the third month, he/she collects again 15000 or above AB and the total by the end of that month will be 15000+29000=44,000 ACTIVITY BRIDGES. So again next month also he/she can purchase products as he/she did last month & continuing SAVING MONEY every month by utilizing AB. ACTIVITY BRIDGES CAN NEVER BE CONVERTED AS MONEY.

BB-BUSINESS BRIDGES
When a Showcase Owner having valid Showcase inside wolmal.com purchases products or services from the Certified Showrooms by online/offline, WOLMAL will issue 1 Business Bridge (BB) for every purchase worth Rs.1000 paid as CASH and this can be accumulated. This Bridge thus accrued by the consumer by PURCHASING PRODUCTS  is termed as BUSINESS BRIDGES (BB). Wolmal will be receiving commissions from those Showrooms for that month and a portion of that amount will be used to calculate the value of each BB of every month (The Value of a single BB will be between Rs.25 and Rs.100) and will be announced on or after 25th of the next month. The value of BB will vary every month based on the Business.
Eg. ILLUSTRATION B: In the first example when the SHOWCASE OWNER paid Rs.2000 as CASH, he/she is eligible to get 2 BUSINESS BRIDGES(BB’s) in that month.(OSO’s are not eligible for any BRIDGES other than AB) If the value of One BB announced for that particular month is Rs.50, he/she may get a CASH BACK of Rs.100 in his/her BB account. (This BB can be viewed inside LOCKER/VALLET at the BUSINESS BRIDGES Button) The announced value of BUSINESS BRIDGEs(BB) will be added to calculate their EARNED BRIDGES (EB) of that Month. (The Formula (which is described in detail below) to Calculate EB is EB=Value of BB+CB+DB.) 

CB – COLLECTION BRIDGES (By HANDSHAKE):
HANDSHAKE is a kind of REFERAL program by which VALID SHOWCASE OWNERS can gain COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB). By inviting Friends, Relatives and Colleagues whom you know well via a link inside HANDSHAKE MENU, Members can extend HANDSHAKE to them. When it is accepted by them and signing up via that link to create FREE account (SHOWCASE)inside wolmal.com it is considered as 1 ACTIVE HANDSHAKE (Referral) is completed. A beginner(OSO) who is of age 25 or above when eligible to attend Introductory Selection Training (NSO Training) of 3 hours duration and that NSO-(Normal Showcase Owner) can have up to 100 HANDSHAKES initially. But if he/she is selected to attend RSO (Registered Showcase Owner) Training, and when it is completed successfully, he/she is eligible to do upto 200 Handshakes.  A REGISTERED SHOWCASE OWNER(RSO) when selected to attend CSO (Certified Showcase Owner) Trainings as per wolmal policy and when it is completed successfully, he/she will be announced as CSO and become eligible to do upto 300 HANDSHAKES. Likewise a CSO PLUS(CSO+) Rank Holder is allowed to do 500 Handshakes within 500 days of Installation from the date of EXAMINATION/ANNOUNCEMENT. 
When those Showcase Owners (Technically called as PARTNERS) referred by the Member of wolmal.com via HANDSHAKES can make BUSINESS BRIDGES (BB) by purchasing  PRODUCTS, the person who did that HANDSHAKE REFERRAL is eligible for 50% of their BUSINESS BRIDGES (BB). These Bridges he/she gained from every HANDSHAKE PARTNER is termed as COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB). (To be eligible for CB, one should have minimum 2 BB in that particular month. CB will be allotted to eligible members for a maximum of continuous 10 years or 120 full calendar months)
Eg. ILLUSTRATION C: Assume that a MEMBER has been selected to attend RSO, CSO & CSO+ training modules and completed successfully to become a CERTIFIED CORE SHOWCASE OWNER PLUS with a “C” displayed along with his/her profile name at MY SHOWCASE PROFILE page AND IF HE/SHE COMPLETED ALL THE ALLOWED 500 ACTIVE HANDSHAKES: Assume as per previous example, he/she purchased 3000 worth products and paid Rs. 2,000 as cash (Balance as AB) and thereby received 2 BB; LET US ASSUME all his/her referred (ACTIVE HANDSHAKE) 500 members also did the same type of purchase and saved Rs.1000 and collected 2 BB’s. Now he/she is eligible for 50% of those BB’s as COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB). So from a single member, he/she gets 1CB (50% of 2 BB) and thus a total of 500 COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB) accrued in that month (500 Members X 1CB = 500CB). Since the value of BB announced is Rs.50 in that month, the value of CB will also be the same (Wolmal has decided that BB,CB & DB will hold same value in every month. So no need of separate announcement) By the above illustration the total amount he/she gain from CB @ Rs.50 for that month is Rs. 25,000. (500 CB x Rs.50=Rs.25,000) 

DB-DIRECT BRIDGES
 These Bridges are exclusive Bridges allotted by Wolmal directly to FRANCHISES (CENTERS) who have done extra miles for promoting the portal.  DIRECT BRIDGES  are Calculated As 10% to 50% of COLLECTION BRIDGES(CB) of all Active Handshakes  Referred By the CENTER OWNER (OSO’s NSO’s, RSO’s, CSO’s & CSO+ are not eligible for DB). Franchise People(CENTER OWNERS) will be trained separately to improve Leadership Skills so as to develop their business by taking care of their partners successfully. They must ensure that their HANDSHAKE PARTNERS get a decent income.
Eg. ILLUSTRATION D: Assume that a Member has been selected as Franchise and all his/her ACTIVE HANDSHAKES are having 100 CB in a particular month, then he/she is eligible for a minimum of 10% of CB (10% 100 is 10DB) ie. 10 DB from each ACTIVE SHOWCASE OWNER. The value of this DB will also be the same as of the announced value of BB. If he/she is getting 10 DB from 100 CONSUMERS, then his/her total DB will be 1000 and if the value of BB announced is just Rs. 50; his/her income from DB will be Rs.50,000 (if eligible as per FRANCHISE RANKING criteria) in that particular month.

EB-EARNED BRIDGES 
The value of Bridges BB,CB,& DB will be calculated and announced on or after 25th of EVERY NEXT MONTH of ACTUAL BUSINESS MONTH in Indian Rupees and will be announced as EARNED BRIDGES (EB) of that SHOWCASE OWNER. The formula to calculate EB is EB=Value of BB+CB+DB.  (The value of One EB will be One INDIAN RUPEE) EB can be redeemed for PRODUCTS from recommended CERTIFIED SHOWROOMS by Qualified SHOWCASE OWNERs. ELIGIBLE NSO/RSO/CSO/CSO+ & FRANCHISES(CENTERS) can request wolmal to convert ELIGIBLE EARNED BRIDGES (EB) to Money (CASH in INDIAN CURRENCY through BANK ACCOUNTS-provided BANK ACCOUNT & PAN CARD DETAILS should be furnished in advance) and after deducting Taxes(TDS) as per Government Rules, the Balance will be credited to their Bank account. 
Eg. ILLUSTRATION E: If a CSO PLUS Rank Holder has 20 BB’s, 500 CB’s  and Zero DB’s (only FRANCHISE CENTERS are eligible for DB’s), his/her EB for this month is calculated as follows. The formula to calculate EB is EB=Value of BB+CB+DB. So here value of 20BB has been calculated as Rs.1000 and of 500 CB as 25,000. Hence EB= 1000 + 25,000 + 0 = 26,000. As per Rule of Wolmal, a CSO PLUS member is allowed to Earn maximum Rs.50,000 only in a month. 
Eg. ILLUSTRATION E (1) In all the above examples the value of 1 BB is given as Rs.50. If it is announced as Rs.100, the EB has to be calculated as EB=Value of BB+CB+DB. BB=Rs.2000, CB= 50,000, DB=0. So 2000+50,000+0=52,000. Here as per rule, a CSO PLUS is allowed to earn maximum 50,000 only: so the EB credited to his/her account will be 50,000 and the balance will go back to Wolmal. (In these situations Members may apply for FRANCHISE CENTERS to Gain the Full Amount).  To Earn Money, All Members have to inform the bank account details requested and also should fill up PAN Card Number. More over (KYC Documents) either Passport or Aadhar /Voter ID Number also should be filled in the space provided at Personal Information at MY ACCOUNTS menu AND COPIES OF  DOCUMENTS (KYC) MUST BE SUBMITTED.

(1)  WOLMAL AFFILIATE/ASSOCIATE CENTER (WAC) 
(2)  WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER (WBC)

WOLMAL AFFILIATE CENTER (WAC):
Allowed to do upto 500 HANDSHAKES within the agreement period of 10 Years(120 Months) and the Maximum Income Limit in a month will be Rs. 1 lakh. The AFFILIATE/ASSOCIATE CENTER is authorised to train and motivate all these 500 PARTNERS to collect their AB, BB & CB and to make sure that they earn a decent income as per their criteria. 
Here the FRANCHISE GAINS DIRECT BRIDGES WHICH WILL BE MINIMUM 10% OF THE CB OF Active PARTNERS.

WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER (WBC): 
Allowed to do upto 1000 HANDSHAKES within the agreement period of 5 Years(60 Months) and the Maximum Income Limit in a month will be Rs. 2 lakh. The BUSINESS CENTER is authorised to train and motivate all these 1000 PARTNERS to collect their AB, BB & CB and to make sure that they earn a decent income as per their criteria. 
Here the FRANCHISE GAINS DIRECT BRIDGES WHICH WILL BE 10% OF THE CB OF Active PARTNERS.

Eg. ILLUSTRATION F1: INCOME OF WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER (WBC)
When this Micro Franchise WBC did 1000 Handshakes and all 1000 partners purchase(example) Rs.3000 worth GROCERIES by paying an amount of Rs. 2000 and the balance 1000 paid as AB in this month, all 1000 people and the Franchise owner also gain 2 BB each. So the CB gained by FRANCHISE OWNER will be 1000 (50% of BB of all 1000 ie. 1BB x 1000 =1000 CB). The Franchise is eligible to gain DB also. DB will be 10% of the CB's of all 1000 partners. for example;If the CB of all partners are (example) 100, then FRANCHISE (WBC) is eligible to gain 10% ie 10 DB from each and the total DB will be 10,000 (10x1000=10,000). If the value announced for BB in that month is Rs. 20, the EB will be calculated by the following method. 
EB = VALUE of BB+CB+DB. 
So 2x Rs.20 + 1000 x Rs.20 + 10,000 x Rs. 20= 40 + 20,000 + 2,00,000 = Rs. 2,20,040/-
Since the WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER(WBC) is eligible only for Rs. 2 lakh in a month, the balance Rs.20,040/- will go back to Wolmal and this TWO LAKH will be deposited in his/her EARNED BRIDGES Box and he/she may request Wolmal to credit the amount to the BANK ACCOUNT after deducting TDS. This may continue and every month & the same BUSINESS may happen and can earn the amount every month for UPTO 5 years (60 Months as per agreement). (To gain EARNED BRIDGES in a month, the MEMBER should have at least 1 BB in that particular month.)

BRIDGES (The Virtual Currency of wolmal.com)
wolmal.com allows people who have a valid Showcase to participate in the Bridges offer. BRIDGES are GIFTS provided by wolmal.com and  is not a right. By doing pre-defined activities on the wall as well as for Purchase of Products and services from the Certified Showrooms, Members can gain different types of Bridges every day and can be accumulated and then all the different eligible Bridges will be calculated for their values and converted to EARNED BRIDGES(EB). Purchases can be done online or directly at the shops and can collect BUSINESS BRIDGES (Bridges will be alloted only to Indian citizens who are living in INDIA- To participate in the BRIDGES PROGRAMME, it is mandatory to fill up the detailed personal information requested) By introducing BRIDGES, wolmal.com intends to support actively participating Members to improve their life style not only by making an income at home but also by using HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS. It will boost up the sale of SHOWROOMS and their revenue also will be increased. A portion of the profits on commissions received from them will be shared among the qualified consumers against their BRIDGES. More over a portion of revenue received from ADVERTISEMENTS will also be shared among them as Bridges. 

THERE ARE 5 TYPES OF BRIDGES
1. AB-ACTIVITY BRIDGES 
2. BB-BUSINESS BRIDGES 
3. CB-COLLECTION BRIDGES 
4. DB-DIRECT BRIDGES 
5. EB-EARNED BRIDGES

A considerable percentage of the revenue from Advertisement and Promotions will be calculated yearly/quarterly /monthly or daily and will be shared and is announced as concerned BRIDGES. All these Bridges other than ACTIVITY BRIDGES (AB) together will be calculated and finally announced as EARNED BRIDGES (EB). These EARNED BRIDGES in Indian Rupees can be redeemed for PRODUCTS or can be carry forwarded or otherwise it can be encashed if permitted (as in the case of NSO/RSO/CSO/CSO+ & FRANCHISES) & else can be returned back to WOLMAL .

AB-ACTIVITY BRIDGES 
By doing pre-defined activities on the wall, (Uploading Photos & Albums, doing Comment, Share etc) a valid showcase holder can accrue ACTIVITY BRIDGES. Every day activity inside the wall may ensure good number of ACTIVITY BRIDGES and will be carry forwarded. These Bridges are called Activity Bridges (AB). “What Activities Reward Bridges?” is displayed inside the HELP button of the LOCKER Menu. ACTIVITY BRIDGES (AB) can be utilized along with Money only to purchase products as per wolmal policy.
 Eg. ILLUSTRATION A. An active SHOWCASE OWNER can do prescribed activities and collect above 500 ACTIVITY BRIDGES as GIFT, if he/she try to do all recommended activities everyday without fail. In this way he/she can collect 15000 or above AB in a month. So by the end of SECOND MONTH he/she will have more than 30,000 AB in his/her account.(This can be viewed inside LOCKER  and a detailed list of each micro transaction also can be viewed at TRANSACTIONS Button) The Normal value of 1 Activity Bridge is Rs.1 (One Indian Rupee). So we may say that now he/she has ACTIVITY BRIDGES to the value of Rs.30,000/- in his/her account. In this month if he/she wishes to purchase Groceries & other necessary products for his Home from Certified Showrooms & when he/she purchases it as online/offline for a total bill of (say for example) Rs.3,000; as per that month policy of wolmal.com, if he/she has to pay (this is just an example only) only Rs.2,000 as CASH and the balance 1,000 will be deducted by wolmal as ACTIVITY BRIDGES from his/her account. Here the CONSUMER could utilize his 1,000 ACTIVITY BRIDGES instead of paying MONEY. So he/she could SAVE (Saving Money equals Earning Money) Rs.1,000 in that month on purchase of NECESSITY PRODUCTS of every home on every month. In other way we may say that EXPENDITURE BECOME EARNINGS. Now he/she has a balance of 29,000 AB in his/her account. When he/she continues to do the activities again in the third month, he/she collects again 15000 or above AB and the total by the end of that month will be 15000+29000=44,000 ACTIVITY BRIDGES. So again next month also he/she can purchase products as he/she did last month & continuing SAVING MONEY every month by utilizing AB. ACTIVITY BRIDGES CAN NEVER BE CONVERTED AS MONEY.

BB-BUSINESS BRIDGES
When a Showcase Owner having valid Showcase inside wolmal.com purchases products or services from the Certified Showrooms by online/offline, WOLMAL will issue 1 Business Bridge (BB) for every purchase worth Rs.1000 paid as CASH and this can be accumulated. This Bridge thus accrued by the consumer by PURCHASING PRODUCTS  is termed as BUSINESS BRIDGES (BB). Wolmal will be receiving commissions from those Showrooms for that month and a portion of that amount will be used to calculate the value of each BB of every month (The Value of a single BB will be between Rs.25 and Rs.100) and will be announced on or after 25th of the next month. The value of BB will vary every month based on the Business.
Eg. ILLUSTRATION B: In the first example when the SHOWCASE OWNER paid Rs.2000 as CASH, he/she is eligible to get 2 BUSINESS BRIDGES(BB’s) in that month.(OSO’s are not eligible for any BRIDGES other than AB) If the value of One BB announced for that particular month is Rs.50, he/she may get a CASH BACK of Rs.100 in his/her BB account. (This BB can be viewed inside LOCKER/VALLET at the BUSINESS BRIDGES Button) The announced value of BUSINESS BRIDGEs(BB) will be added to calculate their EARNED BRIDGES (EB) of that Month. (The Formula (which is described in detail below) to Calculate EB is EB=Value of BB+CB+DB.) 

CB – COLLECTION BRIDGES (By HANDSHAKE):
HANDSHAKE is a kind of REFERAL program by which VALID SHOWCASE OWNERS can gain COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB). By inviting Friends, Relatives and Colleagues whom you know well via a link inside HANDSHAKE MENU, Members can extend HANDSHAKE to them. When it is accepted by them and signing up via that link to create FREE account (SHOWCASE)inside wolmal.com it is considered as 1 ACTIVE HANDSHAKE (Referral) is completed. A beginner(OSO) who is of age 25 or above when eligible to attend Introductory Selection Training (NSO Training) of 3 hours duration and that NSO-(Normal Showcase Owner) can have up to 100 HANDSHAKES initially. But if he/she is selected to attend RSO (Registered Showcase Owner) Training, and when it is completed successfully, he/she is eligible to do upto 200 Handshakes.  A REGISTERED SHOWCASE OWNER(RSO) when selected to attend CSO (Certified Showcase Owner) Trainings as per wolmal policy and when it is completed successfully, he/she will be announced as CSO and become eligible to do upto 300 HANDSHAKES. Likewise a CSO PLUS(CSO+) Rank Holder is allowed to do 500 Handshakes within 500 days of Installation from the date of EXAMINATION/ANNOUNCEMENT. 
When those Showcase Owners (Technically called as PARTNERS) referred by the Member of wolmal.com via HANDSHAKES can make BUSINESS BRIDGES (BB) by purchasing  PRODUCTS, the person who did that HANDSHAKE REFERRAL is eligible for 50% of their BUSINESS BRIDGES (BB). These Bridges he/she gained from every HANDSHAKE PARTNER is termed as COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB). (To be eligible for CB, one should have minimum 2 BB in that particular month. CB will be allotted to eligible members for a maximum of continuous 10 years or 120 full calendar months)
Eg. ILLUSTRATION C: Assume that a MEMBER has been selected to attend RSO, CSO & CSO+ training modules and completed successfully to become a CERTIFIED CORE SHOWCASE OWNER PLUS with a “C” displayed along with his/her profile name at MY SHOWCASE PROFILE page AND IF HE/SHE COMPLETED ALL THE ALLOWED 500 ACTIVE HANDSHAKES: Assume as per previous example, he/she purchased 3000 worth products and paid Rs. 2,000 as cash (Balance as AB) and thereby received 2 BB; LET US ASSUME all his/her referred (ACTIVE HANDSHAKE) 500 members also did the same type of purchase and saved Rs.1000 and collected 2 BB’s. Now he/she is eligible for 50% of those BB’s as COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB). So from a single member, he/she gets 1CB (50% of 2 BB) and thus a total of 500 COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB) accrued in that month (500 Members X 1CB = 500CB). Since the value of BB announced is Rs.50 in that month, the value of CB will also be the same (Wolmal has decided that BB,CB & DB will hold same value in every month. So no need of separate announcement) By the above illustration the total amount he/she gain from CB @ Rs.50 for that month is Rs. 25,000. (500 CB x Rs.50=Rs.25,000) 

DB-DIRECT BRIDGES
 These Bridges are exclusive Bridges allotted by Wolmal directly to FRANCHISES (CENTERS) who have done extra miles for promoting the portal.  DIRECT BRIDGES  are Calculated As 10% to 50% (Usually it will be 10% AND at some special rare Occassions where high amount of profits are received from Business it may announced upto 50%) of of COLLECTION BRIDGES(CB) of all Active Handshakes Referred By the CENTER OWNER. (OSO’s NSO’s, RSO’s, CSO’s & CSO+ are not eligible for DB). Franchise People(CENTER OWNERS) will be trained separately to improve Leadership Skills so as to develop their business by taking care of their partners successfully. They must ensure that their HANDSHAKE PARTNERS get a decent income.
Eg. ILLUSTRATION D: Assume that a Member has been selected as Franchise and all his/her ACTIVE HANDSHAKES are having 100 CB in a particular month, then he/she is eligible for a minimum of 10% of CB (10% 100 is 10DB) ie. 10 DB from each ACTIVE SHOWCASE OWNER. The value of this DB will also be the same as of the announced value of BB. If he/she is getting 10 DB from 100 CONSUMERS, then his/her total DB will be 1000 and if the value of BB announced is just Rs. 50; his/her income from DB will be Rs.50,000 (if eligible as per FRANCHISE RANKING criteria) in that particular month.

EB-EARNED BRIDGES 
The value of Bridges BB,CB,& DB will be calculated and announced on or after 25th of EVERY NEXT MONTH of ACTUAL BUSINESS MONTH in Indian Rupees and will be announced as EARNED BRIDGES (EB) of that SHOWCASE OWNER. The formula to calculate EB is EB=Value of BB+CB+DB.  (The value of One EB will be One INDIAN RUPEE) EB can be redeemed for PRODUCTS from recommended CERTIFIED SHOWROOMS by Qualified SHOWCASE OWNERs. ELIGIBLE NSO/RSO/CSO/CSO+ & FRANCHISES(CENTERS) can request wolmal to convert ELIGIBLE EARNED BRIDGES (EB) to Money (CASH in INDIAN CURRENCY through BANK ACCOUNTS-provided BANK ACCOUNT & PAN CARD DETAILS should be furnished in advance) and after deducting Taxes(TDS) as per Government Rules, the Balance will be credited to their Bank account. 
Eg. ILLUSTRATION E: If a CSO PLUS Rank Holder has 20 BB’s, 500 CB’s  and Zero DB’s (only FRANCHISE CENTERS are eligible for DB’s), his/her EB for this month is calculated as follows. The formula to calculate EB is EB=Value of BB+CB+DB. So here value of 20BB has been calculated as Rs.1000 and of 500 CB as 25,000. Hence EB= 1000 + 25,000 + 0 = 26,000. As per Rule of Wolmal, a CSO PLUS member is allowed to Earn maximum Rs.50,000 only in a month. 
Eg. ILLUSTRATION E (1) In all the above examples the value of 1 BB is given as Rs.50. If it is announced as Rs.100, the EB has to be calculated as EB=Value of BB+CB+DB. BB=Rs.2000, CB= 50,000, DB=0. So 2000+50,000+0=52,000. Here as per rule, a CSO PLUS is allowed to earn maximum 50,000 only: so the EB credited to his/her account will be 50,000 and the balance will go back to Wolmal. (In these situations Members may apply for FRANCHISE CENTERS to Gain the Full Amount).  To Earn Money, All Members have to inform the bank account details requested and also should fill up PAN Card Number. More over (KYC Documents) either Passport or Aadhar /Voter ID Number also should be filled in the space provided at Personal Information at MY ACCOUNTS menu AND COPIES OF  DOCUMENTS (KYC) MUST BE SUBMITTED.

MICRO FRANCHISEs: 
CAN START AT HOME.   At least A TABLE SPACE IS REQUIRED.
2 TYPES of MICRO FRANCHISES.
(1)  WOLMAL AFFILIATE/ASSOCIATE CENTER (WAC) 
(2)  WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER (WBC)

WOLMAL AFFILIATE CENTER (WAC):
Allowed to do upto 500 HANDSHAKES within the agreement period of 10 Years(120 Months) and the Maximum Income Limit in a month will be Rs. 1 lakh. The AFFILIATE/ASSOCIATE CENTER is authorised to train and motivate all these 500 PARTNERS to collect their AB, BB & CB and to make sure that they earn a decent income as per their criteria. 
Here the FRANCHISE GAINS DIRECT BRIDGES WHICH WILL BE MINIMUM 10% OF THE CB OF Active PARTNERS.

WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER (WBC): 
Allowed to do upto 1000 HANDSHAKES within the agreement period of 5 Years(60 Months) and the Maximum Income Limit in a month will be Rs. 2 lakh. The BUSINESS CENTER is authorised to train and motivate all these 1000 PARTNERS to collect their AB, BB & CB and to make sure that they earn a decent income as per their criteria. 
Here the FRANCHISE GAINS DIRECT BRIDGES WHICH WILL BE 10% OF THE CB OF Active PARTNERS.

Eg. ILLUSTRATION F1: INCOME OF WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER (WBC)
When this Micro Franchise WBC did 1000 Handshakes and all 1000 partners purchase(example) Rs.3000 worth GROCERIES by paying an amount of Rs. 2000 and the balance 1000 paid as AB in this month, all 1000 people and the Franchise owner also gain 2 BB each. So the CB gained by FRANCHISE OWNER will be 1000 (50% of BB of all 1000 ie. 1BB x 1000 =1000 CB). The Franchise is eligible to gain DB also. DB will be 10% of the CB's of all 1000 partners. for example;If the CB of all partners are (example) 100, then FRANCHISE (WBC) is eligible to gain 10% ie 10 DB from each and the total DB will be 10,000 (10x1000=10,000). If the value announced for BB in that month is Rs. 20, the EB will be calculated by the following method. 
EB = VALUE of BB+CB+DB. 
So 2x Rs.20 + 1000 x Rs.20 + 10,000 x Rs. 20= 40 + 20,000 + 2,00,000 = Rs. 2,20,040/-
Since the WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER(WBC) is eligible only for Rs. 2 lakh in a month, the balance Rs.20,040/- will go back to Wolmal and this TWO LAKH will be deposited in his/her EARNED BRIDGES Box and he/she may request Wolmal to credit the amount to the BANK ACCOUNT after deducting TDS. This may continue and every month & the same BUSINESS may happen and can earn the amount every month for UPTO 5 years (60 Months as per agreement). (To gain EARNED BRIDGES in a month, the MEMBER should have at least 1 BB in that particular month.)

BB-BUSINESS BRIDGES
When a Showcase Owner having valid Showcase inside wolmal.com purchases products or services from the Certified Showrooms by online/offline, WOLMAL will issue 1 Business Bridge (BB) for every purchase worth Rs.1000 paid as CASH and this can be accumulated.

The value of BB will vary every month based on the Business.
Eg.

CB – COLLECTION BRIDGES (By HANDSHAKE):
HANDSHAKE is a kind of REFERAL program by which VALID SHOWCASE OWNERS can gain COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB). By inviting Friends, Relatives and Colleagues whom you know well via a link inside HANDSHAKE MENU, Members can extend HANDSHAKE to them. When it is accepted by them and signing up via that link to create FREE account (SHOWCASE)inside wolmal.com it is considered as 1 ACTIVE HANDSHAKE (Referral) is completed. A beginner(OSO) who is of age 25 or above when eligible to attend Introductory Selection Training (NSO Training) of 3 hours duration and that NSO-(Normal Showcase Owner) can have up to 100 HANDSHAKES initially. But if he/she is selected to attend RSO (Registered Showcase Owner) Training, and when it is completed successfully, he/she is eligible to do upto 200 Handshakes.  A REGISTERED SHOWCASE OWNER(RSO) when selected to attend CSO (Certified Showcase Owner) Trainings as per wolmal policy and when it is completed successfully, he/she will be announced as CSO and become eligible to do upto 300 HANDSHAKES. Likewise a CSO PLUS(CSO+) Rank Holder is allowed to do 500 Handshakes within 500 days of Installation from the date of EXAMINATION/ANNOUNCEMENT.

CB will be allotted to eligible members for a maximum of continuous 10 years or 120 full calendar months)
Eg. ILLUSTRATION C: Assume that a MEMBER has been selected to attend RSO, CSO & CSO+ training modules and completed successfully to become a CERTIFIED CORE SHOWCASE OWNER PLUS with a “C” displayed along with his/her profile name at MY SHOWCASE PROFILE page AND IF HE/SHE COMPLETED ALL THE ALLOWED 500 ACTIVE HANDSHAKES: Assume as per previous example, he/she purchased 3000 worth products and paid Rs. 2,000 as cash (Balance as AB) and thereby received 2 BB; LET US ASSUME all his/her referred (ACTIVE HANDSHAKE) 500 members also did the same type of purchase and saved Rs.1000 and collected 2 BB’s. Now he/she is eligible for 50% of those BB’s as COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB). So from a single member, he/she gets 1CB (50% of 2 BB) and thus a total of 500 COLLECTION BRIDGES (CB) accrued in that month (500 Members X 1CB = 500CB). Since the value of BB announced is Rs.50 in that month, the value of CB will also be the same (Wolmal has decided that BB,CB & DB will hold same value in every month. So no need of separate announcement) By the above illustration the total amount he/she gain from CB @ Rs.50 for that month is Rs. 25,000. (500 CB x Rs.50=Rs.25,000) 

DB-DIRECT BRIDGES
 These Bridges are exclusive Bridges allotted by Wolmal directly to FRANCHISES (CENTERS) who have done extra miles for promoting the portal.  DIRECT BRIDGES  are Calculated As 10% to 50% (Usually it will be 10% AND at some special rare Occassions where high amount of profits are received from Business it may announced upto 50%) of of COLLECTION BRIDGES(CB) of all Active Handshakes Referred By the CENTER OWNER. (OSO’s NSO’s, RSO’s, CSO’s & CSO+ are not eligible for DB). Franchise People(CENTER OWNERS) will be trained separately to improve Leadership Skills so as to develop their business by taking care of their partners successfully. They must ensure that their HANDSHAKE PARTNERS get a decent income.
Eg. ILLUSTRATION D: Assume that a Member has been selected as Franchise and all his/her ACTIVE HANDSHAKES are having 100 CB in a particular month, then he/she is eligible for a minimum of 10% of CB (10% 100 is 10DB) ie. 10 DB from each ACTIVE SHOWCASE OWNER. The value of this DB will also be the same as of the announced value of BB. If he/she is getting 10 DB from 100 CONSUMERS, then his/her total DB will be 1000 and if the value of BB announced is just Rs. 50; his/her income from DB will be Rs.50,000 (if eligible as per FRANCHISE RANKING criteria) in that particular month.

EB-EARNED BRIDGES 
The value of Bridges BB,CB,& DB will be calculated and announced on or after 25th of EVERY NEXT MONTH of ACTUAL BUSINESS MONTH in Indian Rupees and will be announced as EARNED BRIDGES (EB) of that SHOWCASE OWNER. The formula to calculate EB is EB=Value of BB+CB+DB.  (The value of One EB will be One INDIAN RUPEE) EB can be redeemed for PRODUCTS from recommended CERTIFIED SHOWROOMS by Qualified SHOWCASE OWNERs. ELIGIBLE NSO/RSO/CSO/CSO+ & FRANCHISES(CENTERS) can request wolmal to convert ELIGIBLE EARNED BRIDGES (EB) to Money (CASH in INDIAN CURRENCY through BANK ACCOUNTS-provided BANK ACCOUNT & PAN CARD DETAILS should be furnished in advance) and after deducting Taxes(TDS) as per Government Rules, the Balance will be credited to their Bank account. 
Eg. ILLUSTRATION E: If a CSO PLUS Rank Holder has 20 BB’s, 500 CB’s  and Zero DB’s (only FRANCHISE CENTERS are eligible for DB’s), his/her EB for this month is calculated as follows. The formula to calculate EB is EB=Value of BB+CB+DB. So here value of 20BB has been calculated as Rs.1000 and of 500 CB as 25,000. Hence EB= 1000 + 25,000 + 0 = 26,000. As per Rule of Wolmal, a CSO PLUS member is allowed to Earn maximum Rs.50,000 only in a month. 
Eg. ILLUSTRATION E (1) In all the above examples the value of 1 BB is given as Rs.50. If it is announced as Rs.100, the EB has to be calculated as EB=Value of BB+CB+DB. BB=Rs.2000, CB= 50,000, DB=0. So 2000+50,000+0=52,000. Here as per rule, a CSO PLUS is allowed to earn maximum 50,000 only: so the EB credited to his/her account will be 50,000 and the balance will go back to Wolmal. (In these situations Members may apply for FRANCHISE CENTERS to Gain the Full Amount).  To Earn Money, All Members have to inform the bank account details requested and also should fill up PAN Card Number. More over (KYC Documents) either Passport or Aadhar /Voter ID Number also should be filled in the space provided at Personal Information at MY ACCOUNTS menu AND COPIES OF  DOCUMENTS (KYC) MUST BE SUBMITTED. 


FRANCHISES OF WOLMAL
To start a FRANCHISE CENTER, eligible member has to Submit the Prescribed Filled application form in advance and if selected and allotted, has to Pay the FRANCHISE LICENCE FEE at the Bank Account of WOLMAL and prescribed and approved AGREEMENT in STAMP PAPER (in Duplicate) also has to be submitted by the Member.
ALL FRANCHISE CENTERS ARE ELIGIBLE TO EARN 20% COMMISSIONS ON PAID ADVERTISEMENTS WHICH THEY COLLECTED AND SUBMITTED TO wolmal.com.
There are 3 Types of FRANCHISEs- 
1. MICRO FRANCHISE
2. MINI FRANCHISE
3. MASTER FRANCHISE
MICRO FRANCHISEs: 
CAN START AT HOME.   At least A TABLE SPACE IS REQUIRED.
2 TYPES of MICRO FRANCHISES.
(1)  WOLMAL AFFILIATE/ASSOCIATE CENTER (WAC) 
(2)  WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER (WBC)

WOLMAL AFFILIATE/ASSOCIATE CENTER (WAC):
Allowed to do HANDSHAKES within the agreement period of 10 Years(120 Months) and the Maximum Income Limit in a month will be Rs. 2 lakh. The AFFILIATE/ASSOCIATE CENTER is authorised to train and motivate all these PARTNERS to collect their AB, BB & CB and to make sure that they earn a decent income as per their criteria. 
Here the FRANCHISE GAINS DIRECT BRIDGES WHICH WILL BE MINIMUM 10% OF THE CB OF Active PARTNERS.

WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER (WBC): 
Allowed to do HANDSHAKES within the agreement period of 10 Years(120 Months) and the Maximum Income Limit in a month will be Rs. 5 lakh. The BUSINESS CENTER is authorised to train and motivate all these PARTNERS to collect their AB, BB & CB and to make sure that they earn a decent income as per their criteria. 
Here the FRANCHISE GAINS DIRECT BRIDGES WHICH WILL BE MINIMUM 10% OF THE CB OF Active PARTNERS.

Eg. ILLUSTRATION F1: INCOME OF WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER (WBC)
When this Micro Franchise WBC did 1000 Handshakes and all 1000 partners purchase(example) Rs.3000 worth GROCERIES by paying an amount of Rs. 2000 and the balance 1000 paid as AB in this month, all 1000 people and the Franchise owner also gain 2 BB each. So the CB gained by FRANCHISE OWNER will be 1000 (50% of BB of all 1000 ie. 1BB x 1000 =1000 CB). The Franchise is eligible to gain DB also. DB will be 10% of the CB's of all 1000 partners. for example;If the CB of all partners are (example) 100, then FRANCHISE (WBC) is eligible to gain 10% ie 10 DB from each and the total DB will be 10,000 (10x1000=10,000). If the value announced for BB in that month is Rs. 50, the EB will be calculated by the following method. 
EB = VALUE of BB+CB+DB. 
So 2x Rs.50 + 1000 x Rs.50 + 10,000 x Rs. 50= 100 + 50,000 + 5,00,000 = Rs. 5,50,100/-
Since the WOLMAL BUSINESS CENTER(WBC) is eligible only for Rs. 5 lakh in a month, the balance Rs.50,100/- will go back to Wolmal and this FIVE LAKH will be deposited in his/her EARNED BRIDGES Box and he/she may request Wolmal to credit the amount to the BANK ACCOUNT after deducting TDS. IF ELIGIBLE  & QUALIFIED This may continue every month & the same BUSINESS may happen and can earn the amount every month for UPTO 10 years (120 Months as per agreement). (To gain EARNED BRIDGES in a month, the MEMBER should have at least 2 BB in that particular month.)
